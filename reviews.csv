"
First, this charger looks fantastic. I got the black one and with the glass on the top, the inset lights, and the silver edge... it just looks sleek. Its super thin and as others have commented if you have a chunky charging cable then it won't sit flat but mine does. It stays in place on the table well and even though the top is glass, it holds my phone easily. I use a Pixel 7 pro with a case and it charges through it with  no problems. The lights are not obnoxiously bright and are a convenient indicator if your phone is in the right spot. Even with a case I do not have a hard time seeing the lights. It also seems to enable the charge in any orientation, not just one as others have commented. The charge is a little slower than similar chargers which doesn't bother me. Mostly because it is easy to get the phone in position to charge and easy to see when it is in the correct position. Other chargers are much much more sensitive and don't have large indicator lights.Now for the one drawback - Charging from low battery states. I have a few chargers like this because my phone sees a lot of use and being able to set it down and let it slowly charge at my desks is super convenient. Sometimes when charging overnight from a low battery state ~ less than 10%, it will not fully charge and instead will stop charging at roughly 50%. I am not sure if this is an issue with the phone or charger. It has happened more than once. It only happens during overnight charging from low battery levels. If I start charging at like 30% or more then there is no issue. If you NEED 100% in the mornings then I would not trust this charger to get you there if you have low battery at the start. Its easy enough to just unplug it and plug the phone directly in in those cases. That single drawback isn't much though and for me its a nonissue.Would recommend.

UPDATE:  Well...I was wrong about this wireless charger and I'm increasing my overall rating to 5 stars.  I left my original review below.  According to the Wireless Power Consortium, this device was said to be capped at 5watts for iOS devices and I based much of my review on that assessment.  Tozo reached out to me and asked if I would be willing to use a Digital USB Tester for their product and assess it myself instead of relying on the Wireless Power Consortium assessment.  I told them I would and they sent me the following USB tester sold on Amazon here:https://www.amazon.com/MakerHawk-Multimeter-Impedance-Temperature-Voltmeter/dp/B07DCTG6LHThis tester documentation said it automatically senses the input and output direction of current.  The male USB-C end is labeled ""input"" and female end is labeled ""output"".  I tried it both with the male end plugged into the W1 and with the male end plugged into the AC adapter.  Both readings on the tester were consistent.I used several different USB-C AC adapters, including a 20w from Tozo which I like a lot.  All the adapters I used were 20w or over.  I also used a several different 100w-rated USB-C cables.  You don't need a 100w-rated USB-C cable for the W1 but that is what I used.  Despite what the Wireless Power Consortium says, Tozo is right (and my prior review was wrong):  This charger easily hits 7.5w of fast charging power on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.  In fact, I was able to see fast-charging over 10w at times (see attached).  It is important to note that iPhones do not always invoke fast charging.  iPhones are hard-coded to stop fast charging once the battery reaches 80%.  To be sure I was assessing the W1's full potential, I checked charging power at various battery capacities, though all were under 50%.In my prior review, I said this would ""be perfect if it performed as advertised"".  It does perform as advertised and it is perfect in my opinion; both aesthetically and functionally.  5 Stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Sorry TOZO, but your page is no longer accurate.  According to the Wireless Power Consortium, this product has the Qi Registration ID of 8123.  Unfortunately for iOS users, the W1 uses the Basic Power Profile.  What does that mean?  Well, it becomes very important which power profile a device uses after iOS 13.1.  If a device uses the Basic Power Profile, charging is capped at 5 watts for iOS devices (not 7.5 watts).  To charge at 7.5 watts, a device must use the Extended Power Profile, which this device does not have.  How do I know?  Qi devices register with the Wireless Power Consortium.  I can't post a URL in a review but you can guess the website from the name.  Click on the Product Database and enter 8123 for this product.  There you can see it uses the Basic Power Profile and it is capped at 5 watts.Functionally, this is a very nicely designed charger.  It has a nice clean look and is one of the thinnest.  It works as advertised with green and blue LEDs that cast a very nice illumination through the semi-circular 'windows' in the black tint on each side of the device.  It would probably be perfect if it performed as advertised.  However, it will not achieve the 7.5 watt charging rate it claims.  After iOS 13.1, all devices that use the Basic Power Profile are capped at 5 watts.  Since the charging speed could be overlooked if you aren't measuring it, I thought it important to point that out for iOS users.  I bought this specifically for the fast charging feature that was advertised in this slim, nicely designed device.  Since it definitely does not have fast charging capability for iOS devices, I'm giving it 1 star.Also, as of this review, Amazon bestows the ""Amazon's Choice"" designation for this device.  This is despite the fact that the product page is not factually accurate.  Again, as of this review, there is a large image that says, ""7.5 Watt Fast Charge Mode for iPhone Series"".  That is not accurate for this device.  I even reached out to the Wireless Power Consortium for clarification on this specific product and this is what they said:""We maintain the Qi wireless power standard and we operate a testing and certification program.  You see that we certified the product at 5W.  It is a common problem that manufacturers claim more power than they really deliver.  The Wireless Power Consortium cannot prevent that.""The bottom line here is that if charging your iOS device using a fast charge rate using 7.5 watts is a priority, this device cannot do that.  You will need devices that have the Extended Power Profile.  I won't comment on Android devices but encourage those with Android devices to do their research since if the Wireless Power Consortium states this device is capped at 5W independent of the software ecosystem, I wonder how it could be higher for Android.

This works perfectly on the side table while lounging I can just pop it on and charge up or scroll knowing I am charging at the same time.  Seems to deliver adequate charge to compensate for use too.  Best part is that Android and iPhone with magsafe capability can use it, no more having multiple cords.  Just have these throughout the house for casual charging.
","
I purchased this charger for use in our camper. It's a great charger for when you're not using your phonne you can lay it on the charger to keep it fully charged without the hassle of finding a charging cable and putting it in and out of your phones.
","
Got this for my Samsung Galaxy S23 phone, and love it so far.  A few things most people don't know or hasn't been mentioned much:- Most of the chargers are a little slippery - not quite glass, but polished aluminum.  The Matte Black, however, is grippy - get this one if you're concerned about your phone sliding off, it's some sort of grippy plastic, not aluminum, so the phone doesn't slide around as much- It CAN fast charge your Samsung phone - but you need a good AC adapter AND a good wire.  I recommend Anker for both.  I have the Anker 323/2 port compact charger and an Anker USB A to C premium nylon wire, and my Galaxy S23 says it's fast charging when I plunk it down, but it doesn't say that if I use the AC adapter without the Anker wire.  I guess it's an all-or-nothing deal.All in all, very happy with this purchase
","
I ordered this charger after using one at my sister's house. I should have paid attention to the brand they had since it has quicker charging capability.
","
Came here to see if there was any tips on how to get the charger to start working again and realized I never wrote a review.Bought this in 2019 (it's 2023 now) and it just now started to act up. It will charge then randomly stop and the LED light will turn off. If I take the phone off and wait a few it'll be ""ready"" to charge again only to do the same thing.However in the years I've had it and the 3 moves since then it's worked perfect. It has a nice slim and sleek design. It charges decently, obviously not as fast as if you were to wall charge but for over night charge it's perfect.For the price and the quality, you honestly can't beat that.
","
Device must be placed carefully or it will fail to start charging. Very useful for phones whose charging ports aged out of the system before the lifespan of the phone was complete.
","
Charges like advertised. I did have to take off a thin metal plate off of my iPhone to get it to work. The plate is from the magnetic phone holder in my car. I will disrupt the magnetic signal that transfer energy to the phone. If you have a magnetic phone holder that requires a thin metal plate on the back of your phone, you might want to think twice. I prefer the convenience of the charging pad.
","
I wanted something to use instead of the typical Apple charging cord.  I’m so tired of replacing them.  This doesn’t work in all situations but charging my phone overnight is working well.  The only issue I have is that it takes some repositioning to get it charging and I pray it stays where I put it.  The base is slippery so put it some place that is level and no chance of being bumped.
","
Plugged it in and it works once I put my phone down on the correct spot. I use a double layer case on my phone, and it still charges well.  Bought a second one for my wife after I used mine and was happy with it.
","
Cumple su trabajo
","
This is the second Tozo charger that I have purchased.  Both have worked great.  Many other chargers that I have tried require that the phone is placed exactly in the middle of the device.  The size and low profile of this charger, makes it easy to position the phone quickly.
","
Sharing in case anyone else didn't realize you need to fold your Samsung GalaxyZ Flip phone to charge it on the right spot. It also works with my Samsung Galaxy buds.Love the sleek look of the pink charging pad. The surface is nonskid and nonsmudge.
","
Works great with my Pixel 5 with a leather wallet case on. Charges pretty fast. It takes only 70minutes to charge from 50% to 100%, which is faster than I expected. My phone doesn't work well with the cable charger I have so this is very useful.
","
It recharges through my cover, which I love. Made from quality materials.
","
Love the look of this charger but is not as powerful as I had hoped.  Seems to take a long time for a full charge.  I have this on the nightstand which makes it easy to place but by morning find it has slid off the base and the phone never charged.  It has a little green light that turns blue when charging but is on the top flat side of the disk and can make it difficult to know if the phone is charging.  I had to place a rubber band across the disk to keep the phone from sliding off.  Although it looks very cool, it takes too long to charge.
","
Quality seems good but it doesn’t charge fast.
","
Because you just lay your phone flat on the disk, you don't need a charging cord. However, they do (occasionally) just cease to function, not sure why.
","
Product worked good and loading my phones and other stuff without problems. Even air pod pro cases
","
Great little charger. I read someone's review about how to attach it a stand enabling to use your Kindle Fire in the show mode. Love it.
","
Excelente precio para la calidad

For the money OK must put phone in exactly the right spot. Sometimes doesn't  charge when it should be . Slightly off center.
","
Simple to use.  Charges quickly. No need to plug/unplug.
","
Works great but alignment has to be just right. That can be a little annoying if you're half-awake. Overall, worth the price and would recommend.
","
Did not work for my phone buy Co workers use it often, lol.
","
It works thru the case on my iPhone XR.
","
I was very happy with my purchase. It is simple and easy to use.  The Price can not be beaten.  It works great on my Motorola Edge
","
A year and a half later still works. Small but sufficient and looks elegant.
","
Nonslip backing and charging area is great. You don’t have to be EXACTLY in the middle to charge! Just put your phone on it, in any direction and it’ll charge!Highly highly recommend
","
I got this wireless charger because it actually matches my phone case as well as my headphones and their case. I love the rose gold accessories that I was able to get for my Samsung S20 FE. It works well with android and iPhone and doesn't blend into the background so it's easy to spot on a cluttered desk. Definitely recommend. 5 outta 5!!!
","
Small Qi receiver I installed on my Pixel 4a might be too small, it seems to be have a finicky placement issue. The charging pad works great.

Good

Can charge the iPhone 11 and google pixel 7! I love the design of it too :)
","
Smooth, thin and cool 😎

I don’t know if this is related or I have a bad phone but after using a wireless charger my phone will kit pick up on any of them. I think this damaged it but not 100% sure. Do your research before purchasing. Especially if you have a $1,000 phone.*update: customer service was very responsive to fix the issue. Although my phone will not charge via any wireless charger after using this, they offered a replacement for another product. Will increase a star for customer service and support. That is appreciated.
","
Cheap and works fine, but the charging rate is slow.  I have an S20 FE and it takes about 3 minutes per percent of charge, so if your phone is at 25% power it will take 3 hours and 45 minutes to reach full charge.  I have tried it with various usb sources ranging from 2-5 amps and the output is the same.If you want to charge overnight or are not in a hurry for some reason this will work fine.
","
Charges our Ear Buds Quickly
","
Overall, great. Does what it says, and is as slim as can be to do that. The only downside is how much it attracts dust, but then that's typical for non-slip silicone surfaces, and at least it grips the phone plenty!

Got this product for my tozo golden x1's and my phone, s22 ultra.For the x1's this charger work great and I get it to charge first try.However that's it.Firstly I tried my phone and the charger kept identifying it as a foreign object. Then when I finally got it aimed correctly on the pad the phone charger status told me it would take 2 hours to charge my phone starting from 55%...but that's not all, it revised that ETA again to almost 5 hours.The phone also stated that the charger is non compatible and refused to fast charge. So I did some basic trouble shooting.I tested my Samsung supplied power supply and cable with the w3 charger same problem. Long charge and refusal to fast charge.Tried the Samsung power supply with tozo provided cable and w3 charger. Same issue as aboveSo now I'm checking cables all with the Samsung power supply.Samsung cable results in fast chargeTozo cable has same resultSo the power supply and cables aren't the issue.I finally gave up in the evening and said, ""fine if it take 4 hours tonight, I guess it's better to trickle charge itself anyway"". Boy was I wrong.The phone charged and gave a estimated 5 hours to full but when I woke up (7 hours elapsed) the phone stopped charging in the night and left the phone at 75%Disappointed in this product for its main function.As for the sleep friendly. It's not friendly. Just because the light is small and recessed the blue led illuminates my room and I prefer a pitch black room so this thing light up like a Christmas tree in the otherwise void environment of light.I got the w3 90mm over the 100mm because it was the only charger stating a sleep friendly design (not so)I dont mind it showing me that the charger is in standby and changing to blue when charging but does it have to display that light the whole time? The standby I can understand but change the code so the charging led goes off a minute after initiation. My phone already has indicators on and off screen to indicate it is charging and pretty much any device (tozo, any Samsung I owned, Apple, google) will do the same. Having the charger indicating it is charging is redundant and a irritant for those using this for bedroom sleep use.In conclusion, I really think tozo could have done better. With the products functions and biggest of all its capability to charge. I'm not sure if I was suppose to get the 100mm but none of their products 65mm, 90mm and 100mm inform the consumer whether the size of pad will affect the charging capability of the device soon to be used.As for me and any s22 ultra users. I would not buy this again and I truly hope tozo can provide some clarity. I'm really hoping this error is mine and not the company, I put my loyalty into their ear bud products from the tozo 10, 12 and x1. I would absolutely be disappointed if this charger is in fact a 13 is dollar paper weight for the s22 ultra.

I bought this charger a year ago for myself. It’s a great charger. I’ve plugged it, unplugged it, transferred it between rooms, traveled with it, and it’s been trustworthy. I like the indicator lights that tell you when you’ve successfully placed whatever you’re charging, especially when the device isn’t able to tell you itself.
","
It does what it tells you it does, and hasn’t broke on me. Solid 10/10
","
I ordered a few of these for strategic placement throughout my home and one in my office.These are nice, low-profile, and relatively inconspicuous. The comment ""that's a really cool coaster"" has been heard at least twice.The LED indicators are very helpful in knowing what the charging status is, and the green while nothing is charging looks really nice in the dark.There's one thing to be aware-of though, the glass on top seems to scratch very easily... I accidentally scratched one of them pretty badly with my fingernail trying to remove a sticker. This is definitely not normal use though, so I suspect it will be just fine as long as you don't attack it with your fingernails.
","
I ordered 1. I liked it so much I ordered 2 more to replace some of my older wireless chargers.
","
Exit: customer service contacted via email and sent me a replacement. Received it within a few days. It works great now with no issues. Thank you!Light comes on, but it does not work. Disappointed in this purchase. I’ve tried different cords and power blocks. All meet manufactures specification in power supply.
","
My Pixel 7a only supports 5W wireless charging, but even so it should easily charge to full overnight. But this charger only ever seemed to get it to about 80% and would leave the phone quite hot. Also, although there is only a single small LED, it was bright enough to bother me on my nightstand. I bought a similar form factor charger from another brand which consistently charges my phone to 100%, doesn't make it hot, and where the LEDs (which are a circle around the whole pad) shut off after just a few seconds once you put your phone on it.
","
Let me just say(given that I have had this for less than 24 hours)Pros:Charges through fabricsSLEEK, I mean very nice looking. It’s made of some type of metal and has a firmly rooted base given the 4 foot silicone pad distribution, and what I can only assume is a slightly more weighted bottom, designed to eliminate sliding of the charger at any point.This is a major plus for me. Although I live in EVER flat Florida where inclines are not terribly of concern, I detest the sliding that seems to be inevitable with all other wireless chargers and any surface without enough texture to repel sliding. This will occur regardless of how flat your region is, and I personally don’t like to ever have to worry about this becauseMy phone must be removed from its protective casing in order to charge.If you’re like me and have always wondered why wireless chargers felt so damn flimsy, like two cheap pieces of plastic glued over a chip/board and maybe a flimsy ring of silicone atop the surface to “deter” slide.First off, hell na. Leaving my phone or devices wirelessly charging means they will be exposed to all other forces or nature in the house, however restrictive or graceful or hurried they may be, so NO I do not like to play around given these circumstances.All aside these pros, the design of the sleek cool weighted metal is one that leaves me feeling like I have a significantly higher end product than the cost would have eluded to.Super happy so far!CONSHighly rapid I am to assume, IF ONLY it came with the high speed charging cable (3.0) required to enable HIgh speed battery charges so I could test thiSOtherwise nothing, this item has far exceeded my expectations given the price, but not given the company, which I have been recently introduced to and which is seemingly determined to output some reliable products which SURPRISE SURPRISE, perform at or better than advertised specs. Thank you TOZO. And please continue making products like these, they far outweigh the majority of competitors in terms of quality and what I can only assume is a lot of user testing.Note.. I was taken to this review page during my one year free warranty signup from the included QR code, however I am fairly irregular with ratings, but as I have been pleasantly surprised, I just went with it and decided to rate it my own volition.

flat design and easy compatible

Easy to use and very convenient.

Product info says Included Component USB-C cable,  but it's not USB-C on both ends, it's USB-A on the other.  No pictures were shown of both ends of the cable.  To make matters worse, there was an 'Add an Accessory"" for the TOZO C1 USB C 20W adapter under the 'add to Cart'  so I added the AC adapter only to learn it's USB-C.  So now I have the device and AC adapter from same company as recommeded by either TOZO or Amazon and it doesn't work until I order a real USB-C to USB-C connector.  IF THEY JUST DOCUMENTED ACCURATELY the cable I'd given it 5 stars....

I bought this charger cause my coworker has it and it charges my phone w case and pop socket,  other wireless chargers don't charge if it has pop socket so I like this one.
","
Purchased in June 2022…….worked……died December 31, 2022.Followed the Amazon links for the manufacturer trouble shooting advice…..got a 404 messsage that the website no longer exists.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!- - - - - UPDATE 3-30-23 - - - - - -The TOZO manufacturer reached out to me after seeing my previous 2* review. The told me there had in fact been a defect in the charger that I had purchased. They offered me a upgraded replacement and I accepted.This is a great example of Honest and Fair Customer Service and I appreciate their follow-up after my negative experience.  The new charger was sent immediately and is working great!!!

I bought this for my husband and he loves it! Only downside is you have to put whatever you’re charging right in the middle, so charging his phone and earbuds at the same time is tricky but doable.

I have tested numerous Charging Pads or Stations.  I bought a Halo Charging Station, $35, with three different ports on side of unit, USB A, C, etc.  They worked fine.  However, the main function of the unit, the top charging pad, was useless.  Nothing would charge.  Moreover, I tried quite a few other standard charging pads, all either did not work at all, or charged so slow they were useless.  This Tozo Pad W3, worked immediately and charges very quickly.  I have to say, Tozo products as a whole are quality and never fail in performance.  I own, or have owned four or five different styles of their earbuds, all great.  I have given Tozo products as gifts always good feedback.  Pricing of Tozo products is phenomenally low in view of quality and performance.  I highly recommend the W3 Pad.
","
I love this charger so much that I bought 4 of them!!  They charge quickly and are beautiful too!I leave it plugged in all the time and just put my earbuds or phone on it whenever.  Best buy ever!!
","
This charger (M-100mm model, 5.3 mm thickness) is so thin that if you put your phone on it parallel to its power cable (see photo), then your phone is not going to rest fully on the surface of the charging pad but form a bridge between the power cable and the opposite edge of the charging pad (see photos). The thinnest USB-C plug I've found is 6.5 mm thick, so the gap can be as little as 0.6 mm and Your phone will be close enough to charge OK, but over time the phone will show signs of wear as the pad rubs it at the two small points of contact.To avoid that you can put your phone on the pad at 90 degrees to the pad's power cable (see photo), but then your phone will entirely block the pad's indicator lights and you won't get visual confirmation that your phone is charging or an indication of when the phone is charged.This doesn't make the pad entirely useless, it just makes its indicator lights mostly useless, and you can place your phone at an awkward angle to see part of the indicator light. Not a problem if you don't care much about the design of the everyday things in your life, but if you value good design this could be an issue for you. An issue which could have been entirely avoided by having the indicator lights at 90 degrees from where they are now, or by having 4 indicator lights at 90 degrees from each other instead of 2 lights at 180 degrees as in the current design. A missed opportunity.

Ok. So here is another amaizing product from tozo.One of my fastest and smallest chargers. Its listed for the IPhone's which I don't know much about iPhones. So I bought it for my wife thinking I know she has one this will probably work for her. Apparently it doesn't oh, but not because of the design of the charger, but because my wife has an older iPhone and it does not have the special magnetic connection for the fast charger. So now I use it is a Ultra portable super small wireless charging station for my Tozo wireless charging headphones. So i provided a picture of it sitting beside the total number W1 wireless charging pad which is ultra thin and wide. That one normally sits next to my bed for my phone. But I have so many of these wireless headphones that I purchased throughout the last two years from tozo oh, that my phone competes with them for the charging. Since my wife's phone doesn't have the special maintenance in the back of her phone I get to keep this little guy. Some great features about this is said it's small, it has a c type plug so it doesn't matter which direction you plug it in. I have a battery packs if this connect to that has the C type female plug. Which allows me to use the regular USB for other items that I'm charging. It has a very long cord it's about 3 ft long so it doesn't need to be so close to the wall charger or other items I'm charging. And it charges fast. Tozo has some of the fastest Chargers I've ever owned, it took my phone from 5% to 100% in less than an hour. Totally ridiculous on speed. It took my headphones from completely dead to 100% in about 30 minutes. All I can say is if you're buying from tozo, chances are you're going to love the item. I heard about these guys about 2 years ago when I was looking for headphones and now I have about a dozen items from them. The warranty is by far the best I've ever had, as if there's an issue you simply email them and they get back to you within a day. I tested this out just to see how long it would take for them to contact me, fortunately I've never had to use it, not a single one of my items has failed me. And I have a set of wireless charging headphones that are 2 years old oh, and I still get 6 hours of use form the headphone every time I use them each. Love their products. Thanks tozo

Actual product is very nice and well built in addition to having a reasonably good price point . However, maybe my experience was a isolated case due to missing charger cable. Therefore, I have to rate quality control a fail and the product a win.

I ordered 2 of these wireless chargers both as a package deal with 2 different earbud sets. One came wrapped in cellophane and you can tell it’s brand new the other looks like it was already used box not wrapped in cellophane and it had a big scratch on it. I like the first but but I’m not please with the second one. The boxes they came in are even different even though it’s the exact same brand and model. Also the scratched one isn’t charging properly. I’m giving 3 stars bc I really like the new one but very displeased to get a used one when I ordered 2 new ones.
","
Works perfectly!!!!!
","
This charger came really quickly and was quick to set up. It also looks great, and came with a USB-C lead, but no AC adaptor, although this didn't really matter and was stated in the product description.
","
Charges my phone at a good pace. Location of charging spot is finicky so you have to play with the device until the light turns blue.
","
Charge is a little slow and the phone has to be positioned just right, but does the trick even with a phone case on the iphone.
","
I like it
","
Most of the reviews say this doesn't work with their Motorola phone, but it works just fine with my Motorola Edge 2022.  I plugged this wireless charger into a 3A 5V USB wall charger, set phone on top and it started charging the phone immediately.  Good enough for me.
","
Got this for my mom who has difficulty with her hands and small precise movements. Our other wireless chargers had ridges on them and she would have to keep adjusting her phone position just right until it would work. That seemed pointless. This is incredibly thin and flat and has made it much easier for her. She doesn't have to try and center or balance everything. Also the light feature is helpful. Its stylish and she likes it.
","
Title says the pros.  Very subtle and non intrusive.  The con is the green led is on all the time when not charging.  It charges my iPhone 10s as slowly as any induction charger. 1% every 2-3 minutes.  Placement is a bit finicky; you need to double check the light turns blue or it may not be changing.

Charges my Samsung quickly, even in OtterBox. Well made. Great value.

Very nice, solid metal case with rubber pads on the bottom and a polished top surface. Works well with Pixel 6 phone, but does not deliver the full advertised power.The label on the unit says 5v-2A or 9v-1.57A, but it does not actually draw or provide that much charging power. I tested this charger with a Pixel 6 phone, both with the case on the phone and off the phone. I tested with multiple USB power bricks. With a Google USB-C power brick that supports PD, the charger negotiated 9 volts and when charging it drew between 6 and 7 watts, not the full 10 watts as advertised, but it did work reliably.  When I tested with a USB-A power brick, the charger only drew about 3.5 watts. Note that the charger comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable, so you need to use a different cable with a USB-C brick that supports PD to get the highest charging rate.Note the green LEDs on the pad (which turn blue when charging). The LEDs cannot be turned off, so be aware of this if you plan to use it in a bedroom.

I received this as part of a promotion.  This is my first wireless charger and it does work.  Unfortunately compared to plugging it in with the standard cable it is really slow.  For that reason I don’t find myself using it very often.It might be totally normal to charge really slow via a wireless method.  I just don’t have anything else to compare it to to know if this is slower than other wireless products.
","
I had a charger like this for my iPhone and I used it when my charging cord broke.. it was a lifesaver because I had no other way to charge my iPhone..the one I had previously worked well, so I had to buy another one just in case.. I like it!! It seems to charge a lot faster than my old one and it’s nice when I have company and their phone is low on battery and they have a totally different phone than mine…this will charge a lot of different smartphones without needing their specific cord, which in my book is a win win!!

What I do like about this charger is it's slim and it's green light turns blue when charging so ik it's working. What I dislike is even with my thinner phone cases it doesn't continue to charge so I have to take my case off for it to charge. It also is pretty slow at charging, granted I just use this when I'm playing at my PC on the weekend so I'm not on my phone nor need it to be 100% immediately. I have been tempted to try it overnight and see if it'll fully charge by the time I have to get up but I just havent

This is my first wireless charger for my iPhone 12. I thought wireless chargers wouldn't work for my phone as my phone is always in a thick Otterbox case. But, I was surprised, this charging pad not only works well, it feels solid and well-made.
","
Update from 27th April, 2023:The Tozo customer support reached out to me and offered a replacement to try out and it is possible I either had a faulty unit or the older iPhone case I had wasn't working well with the wireless charged. Anyway, I currently use this in my office and so far it is working out well.Original Review:I bought this to use with my iPhone 14 Pro Max on the bed side table. It was hard to find the perfect alignment to charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max. It works sometimes but mostly the phone will start charging and then stop at some point. It happened to me that a lot of the nights I'll put my phone to charge on this wireless charging pad and it would've stopped charging in the middle and my phone won't be fully charged in the morning. I ended up returning this and bought the Apple Magsafe charger which is perfect for apple devices.
","
I received this. This is my first wireless charger and it really works. Unfortunately, it's really slow compared to plugging in with a standard cable.
","
The charger came very quickly. It is made very well and I love how classy it looks  but I really like how fast it charges my phone
","
You will put it on the charger and it will show blue which means it’s charging five minutes later it will change to green so you have to keep moving it and monitoring it and babysitting it. I don’t have time for this. I got no time.
","
Works great.  Easy to use… only negative, if it is a negative, is the LED indicator light is VERY BRIGHT.  I use in my bedroom and have to put something over my phone and charger so it doesn’t light up the room at night, cuz it does if I don’t cover it.
","
And working as expected. The egde of the plastic package is so sharp, almost cut my finger
","
I purchased this so I could easily charge my phone passively at work.  It works exactly as intended and the sleek look of the charger lets it fit into a professional setting.  The included cord is a bit short for the purpose of running it behind the desk as intended, and there is not an included power brick.  The charging is pretty slow, but it is perfect for maintaining battery life throughout the day.  I don't know if the wattage rating of the power brick would make this charge faster or slower, but it is worth considering.

Was told they work descent

I do not often write reviews, but maybe this will help others. My search for a magsafe compatible wireless charger. TLDR - the Tozo W6 checked all the boxes for me.I compared the top 3 rated chargers (as of Jan 2021), the Tozo, the RAVPower, and the Yootech. My devices - iPhone 12 Pro Max and Air Pods Pro. I have a bumper case with a clear polycarbonate back. I did not remove the case for testing. The polycarbonate back is approximately 1.5 mm thick.Magnet - The Tozo locked in place and stayed put. Not easy to bump loose and knock off. The other two chargers were easy to bump loose and the magnets were much weaker.Cord - The Tozo cord is heftier than the RAVPower cord. They are both about the same length, 38 to 39 in. The Yootech cord was the most substantial and about 60 in long.Construction - The Tozo is solidly built and feels more substantial in hand. The other two, not so much. Without putting them on a postal scale for exact weights, I will say the Tozo feels like it weighs more than the others and that probably explains why the magnetic attachment seems so much better on this one. The Tozo also had the smallest diameter of the 3, 2 5/16 in or 58 mm.Compatibility with charging bricks. I am always trying out different charging bricks. By charging brick, I mean those chargers that have multiple USB-C and multiple USB A ports. I like a clean desk and don't want a bunch of individual chargers plugged in. I tested using both C and A ports. Your mileage may vary. I buy bricks that have the highest output power I can find. The Yootech was finicky and not so compatible. The Tozo and RAVPower both worked well with most of my bricks.Magsafe Compatibility - The Tozo was the only charger that would consistently trigger the iPhone to display the Magsafe charging ring.

One with the red wire is the direct charge from the supplied usb wall block. Second is use of the wireless charger underload. The wattage is lower, and also note that you will lose watts between the phone and charger. If you don't know that much about electronics you should probably at least know that if you purchase this you more than likely want to buy it along with its wall plug as plugs may differ in voltage and maximum amp draw. What they sell is one that gives the maximum output for the charge speed.
","
Will buy again thin and charges fast
","
This charger works great and is thin enough to disappear on your desk.  I tried it with a Bose earbud charging case, Samsung S23, and iPhone 14 Pro and it worked with all of them with no problems.
","
I was hoping it would charge a bit faster than it does. It definitely works, but just doesn't charge as fast as I would like. I gifted it to my bf and he likes it for his desk
","
This is good at charging wirelessly, but I didn’t notice when I purchased it (I was looking for a fast charger since my phone battery isn’t what it used to be) that you already need to have a fast USB charger for this to plug into for it to actually provide a benefit. I didn’t remember to return in time so now it slow charges with the usb adapters I have laying around. It is an attractive piece on the counter though.
","
Suppose it did what it's supposed to do considering it's wattage output. Also, since it doesn't come with its own adapter you have to try to find an adapter that has the right output for it too or else it's super slow... If I leave my phone case on, it still charges through it, although it gets the case really really hot.

I own a new Samsung S21 Ultra and was looking for a wireless charger that did the job fast, looked premium and doesn't take up a lot of space on the nightstand. This little gadget does the trick and fulfills or exceeds each requirement!First, it's a good weight and the casing is made of metal. The charger has a small foot print but large enough ""sweet spot"" for the connection to be made with the phone. Also, I love how low profile it is. This disc is maybe an 1/8"" thick. 1/4"" at most. I haven't actually measured it myself. It would also be very easy to grab and go for traveling as the disc disconnects from the provided USB-C cable at the disc itself. So I'll keep a spare cable and brick in my bag and take this until my second one comes in.Yep I ordered a second one for ""on the go"" places and also ordered one for my Mom's iPhone. She'll love it.Oh, how could I forget? You probably want to know how fast it charges. Well, from what I can tell, I last had about 20% juice left on my phone and it charged it to 100% in about an hour and a half. Maybe slightly longer. In wireless charging terms, that's fast! Now I do have it paired with a 5A 30w brick, to be fair and this phone is brand new. But still, the one I previously purchased which was the ugly white plastic folding travel charger that could also accommodate ear buds and a watch was PAINFULLY slow. This crushes the competition and the price is less than half of the big hunk of junk I bought a few weeks ago on here.I'm very happy with this purchase and would advise you to give it a try and quit torturing yourself as to finding the right charger. This is it. This is the right charger. And I'm super picky about form and function. Give it a try, make sure you have a really good brick and enjoy! I'll update you if there's any issues that arise.
","
Easier to find charging points than other brands we have. good price
","
Only one that works with my case .. winner !!
","
I like that is a mostly flat and easy to use.
","
I put my Samsung S10+ phone with 57% on the charger and it indicated one hour 50 minutes to full charge. My wired charger indicated one hour zero minutes to full charge. Returned this charger.
","
I already have a great charger that I purchased directly from Apple for my iPhone. That charger charges quickly but the only real issue I have (if I were to call it an 'issue') is that I can only charge one device at a time.The entire reason I bought this, and what I thought I was getting when I bought this, was a device that can quickly charge more than one Apple device at a time (say, both your phone + airpods, simultaneously).But as you can clearly see with me showing even my smallest chargeable device (Airpod Pros) -- even small headphones occupy all the charge space this device can offer at one time.This version costs more than its predecessor by at least $10, and I don't see why, because it's still only charging one device at a time.The [small] charging device here looks nice, it charges fine, but what I dislike the most is it only charges one device at a time and that is simply not the solution I was looking for and is not what I thought I'd have when I bought this. I want fewer cords and more efficient solutions for my tech -- not yet more cords and more clutter.I'm returning this item for precisely this reason and will be back on the market seeking something that can charge several devices at a time.
","
... but that may be mostly the case's fault. Still, I expected better. After all, we are going to use cases, aren't we?
","
This is the most satisfying charger I've ever had. The charging is fast. Easy to install and simple indication. The charging light goes blue when charging, and it turns green when finish. Highly recommended.
","
I purchased the TOZO W1 wireless charger for my TOZO NC9 earbuds. I am extremely pleased with both my purchases. The charger is perfect.  I just have to simply place my earbud case on top of the charger when they need a charge and that’s it. I dealt with TOZO’s customer service, Nichole, and she was outstanding. She helped me so much with my purchase. It’s so nice to have someone that actually took the time to help me in such a kind way. I couldn’t be happier with my purchases and the customer service that I received.
","
I love it my daughter an friends r ordering it
","
Just got this yesterday. Fast shipping (Prime is good, folks). Plugged it in, set my Galaxy S-20+ on it and BAM!! it went into a fast charge frenzy. The lights were green then with the phone on it successfully, it changed to blue. No hassles, no lining it up correctly, no worries. This thing works great. Charged my phone in less than 2 hours from 36% to 100%, just like that. I will update the review after having it for awhile, but right now, it was a welcome purchase move. I recommend you buy 1 2. (one too).
","
I was bummed because this marketing led me to believe that the actual charger was wireless; meaning it didn’t need to be plugged in in order to charge my phone and that isn’t the case.
","
Don’t get me wrong this wireless charger works and looks great. The problem is the speed at which this thing charges… your way better off plugging your phone in then using this thing. And also you have to have your phone placed perfectly in the middle and at a specific angle to make it work properly.Looks good but doesn’t function good.
","
I bought this a few months ago (November 2022) and I've been using it every workday since.  It charges great, seems well made, and is really a nice looking product.  I just noticed today that it has developed a crack in the top glass part.  I don't think I've been rough putting my phone on and off of it, and the charging still works, so I will continue to use it for now, but I'm sort of bummed out by the crack.Update - company reached out and sent me a new one.  Thanks for the great customer service.
","
The charger works great and fast. The one downside I noticed is that there seems to be some interference with my blue tooth remotes on occasion. I had to move it away from my TV and remote and realize this is what was causing it. This is the reason for the 4 star rating.Other than that, its a 5 start product and I will buy it again if needed for the price point.
","
It does what is supposed to do only compliant is you have to sit the phone in the right spot or it wont charge
","
Bought one for myself, works pretty well aside from sometimes not picking up my device depending on position or cases in between such as my airpods in a case or my phone with a case, sometimes it doesn't pick up because of its position but this one works well and seems to be worth the price, travels well enough.
","
I bought this wireless charger as a replacement. This one is smaller and thinner. This one looks like a high quality product. It includes a usb adapter and a nice strap to keep the cord organized. These are great chargers because they stick to the back of your phone so you don't have to worry about not setting your phone on it correctly and it not charging.
","
slim and sleek, works as advertised.  Does not seem to do rapid charging.
","
Excelente presentación. Carga sin problema
","
I bought this along with the Tozo W1.  The W1 works well, and I thought I’d keep the W6 as a smaller travel charger.  I’m not really satisfied with it though, and here are my reasons:1) the smaller size makes it a little more challenging to line up my phone with it to start charging.  There are no indicator lights like on the W1 model, so I have to rely on my phone’s screen to see if it has started charging (which takes longer, meaning adjusting to find the sweet spot takes longer).2) the magnetic feature doesn’t work through my phone case (and it’s not a particularly thick case).  This may be part of why it’s so hard to line up for charging.3) the USB power cord does not unplug from the charging disc, it is hard wired.  This concerns me, since if I am using it for travel it will be thrown into bags and pockets where the cord will eventually wear out, and I won’t be able to replace it.  The W1 model, though bigger, has a power cord that disconnects and I can replace it with any USB-C cable (along the same lines, I already have other devices that take a USB-C cable and I could easily swap them between devices as needed).So, the quality of this appears to be good; no defects to the best of my knowledge and it seems solid.  If the above issues are of no concern to you, then I recommend it.  For me though, this design doesn’t fit my needs.
","
the item is good enough
","
Manufacturing reached out and replaced my item, and the new one works perfectly. It’s nice looking, has a tiny light that indicates when it’s charging. It’s sleeker looking than a lot of the chargers I have.Old review: Liked the way it looked, but it keeps losing power. I have to keep unplugging and replugging in the charger to get it to start working again. Completely takes away from convenience factor of not needing to plug this in!
","
I bought this for my office to be able to charge my iPhone 13 and not have to worry about constantly plugging in my phone and unplugging it.  I didn’t time how long it took my phone and I didn’t check the actual percentage, but I went from somewhere around 25% to 75% in a little under 20mins.
","
Would be better if it came with an adapter.
","
So far, the W6 has done it's job nicely for me.  I have an iPhone 11 and it has no problems mating with that.  I use a phone case and I can still feel the magnet telling me where to align to.  I don't depend on a wireless charger to hang off the back while I'm using it, so I don't need something that grips to that extent.  I also don't have any larger accessory that this needs to fit into - I just use it as a standalone additional wireless charger so I don't always have to walk back to my bedroom to charge.  This is also nice as a travel charger since it's smaller than my combo watch/phone wireless charger I typically use.It's sleek, lightweight, and seems well built.  It also has an included adapter to use for old style USB connections to computers vs the newer USB-C.One suggestion I would make that would be a cheap convenient addition would be to add a couple of non-stick stickers/adhesives so this could be set on a slicker surface without risking that it slides off.  Because it's smaller and lighter, when set upon a surface like a marble countertop, it can possibly slip off.  When a device is on top and it's actively charging, this isn't an issue as the weight of the device provides enough weight to keep it in place.  But just 3-4 optional small non-slip stickers that could be applied to the bottom would be a nice cheap addition.I haven't found that this gets hot, which is typically a sign of good efficiency.  I haven't compared how quickly this charges vs other models, but for my purposes (charging 1x a day typically overnight), any wireless charger I use doesn't need to be ultra-fast.All in all, a nicely priced, good quality wireless charging pad that's flexible and nicely compact for travel.

Work great I got my wife 1 too

I got this to use with my QI-compatible mouse, had it for a few weeks now and it works just fine. It gets a wee bit warm but I think that's normal for QI charging, it never gets hot enough to be of concern. Build quality is excellent, and this one came with a Type C cable, which I wasn't expecting (from what I can remember of the images when I bought it, I thought it was Micro USB). It's nice because I happen to have a lot more Type C cables than anything else at this point.The light ring is nice as well, it's solid green when nothing is charging, blue while charging, and flashes between cyan and blue when the position needs to be adjusted so the device will charge properly. As far as I can tell the lights don't ever turn off, might be annoying on the bedside table but since this lives on my desk I don't really mind, I can clearly see when it has power just by glancing at it.Last thing about it is charging speed, I don't really have much experience with QI and none of my devices support it, with the exception of my mouse (what I got it for) and one pair of TWS headphones. I have no idea what the rated QI speeds for either of these are, but what I do know is that it is a bit slow, especially compared to the Type C supercharging speeds I'm used to. The mouse normally should take 2 hours to charge fully over Type C, when I use this QI pad it takes about 2 hours to charge 5-10%. Might be the mouse, who knows, I don't really care because I leave it to top-up charge overnight. Just something to keep in mind.
","
It is easy to use, the only concern is the proximity of the charging station and the phone under charge.  As far as when the charging station finishes charging the phone you have no indication that it has been fully charged, color changes or flashing LED’s
","
These are so easy to use. No searching for port for cable to be inserted into. Just lay your phone down and watch for the charging connection symbol and walk away. It will charge through our phone case. We have one on the kitchen table and in our bed room.Even works great on dead phones. Just make sure your phone allows for this type of charging.
","
This is a very handy little wireless charger. Built sold and of mostly metal. Works well but requires a little juggling to get phone to charge right (but we have cases on our phones). Only complaint is not against the product itself but the fact they sent me the wrong one. I wanted the black large one and they sent me the white and gold one. Wife likes it though so gave it to her. May order another but don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back again if it's wrong. I have like 50 different places to charge my phone at my house. Do I take need one more place? Great for traveling though!
","
Too show
","
Very nice phone charger. Good design and of high quality.
","
Great charger! Bad for warming coffee. LOL No, nothing happened but for a second, I put my coffee on it. I can honestly say it was dumb on my part, but it knows the difference between coffee and phones.
","
For the price it’s pretty good quality
","
What can I say so simple plug it in..drop on buds, phone whatever is compatible. Charges quickly and is so small. I do wish the indicator lights would turn off once on for awhile but most others do the same. Saw this in the store the other day and got another for the office. Good buy
","
Purchased for two of our cell phones, great product, easy to know when it's charging properly, there's a colored light that comes on when your phone is placed and positioned properly on this charger.
","
I think it is is great product especially for the price. It can be a little annoying when trying to sleep because it has a green light when there is no phone on it and a blue light when the phone is on.
","
The light around the edge stays on when charging so could interrupt your sleep.
","
Great
","
Love to use this at work on my desk. Will only charge your phone while plugged in. The cord is not very long so you can’t use your phone while it charges unless you sit close by. Does not charge your phone very fast, but it’s decent enough if you’re not in a hurry.
","
I recently purchased a Tozo wireless charger 10W fast charging pad style.The wireless charger is nice and sleek because it’s an easy way to charge your phone without the hassle of a cord. It is thin and doesn’t take up a lot of room on a desk or a night stand. Love the non slip feet, it  prevents anything from slipping from my glass top on my nightstand. It lost one star because It takes longer than a normal charger to charge, but the convenience of it balances out the slower charging rate.
","
One of the better looking Qi chargers on Amazon, with a nice mirror finish top with accent/status lights.The top being mirror finish doesn't provide the most grip, however.Another gripe for some users would be the green stand by light constantly remaining on. Changes to blue when charging. This didn't bother me.Charge test using the the Google 30 Watt PPS power brick, Google USB-C cable, and Pixel 6 Pro with optimized charging off to get the full charge delivered, the screenshot shows the numbers the Tozo generated pulled using the Accubattery Pro app.4.077 V * (1974 mA/1000) = 8.048 wattsLess than the 10 it advertises using optimal power brick and USB-C cable that came with the Pixel Stand gen 2.The most likely reason for this is the Tozo Qi charger didn't have extended power profile (EPP) and instead uses the basic power profile according to the wireless power consortium. I must take a star off for this.However, for the price point and aesthetic qualities, this is a good travel charger for when you wish to charge overnight while resting. If you need something quicker for day use, I'd recommend going for a Qi charger with EPP.
","
We use it to charge wireless earbuds. It’s convenient to just lay the charging case on the charger without having to plug in the cable. We could charge the phone on it too, we just don’t.  Bought one for a gift before buying one for our use, I would buy again.
","
After trying a few wireless chargers I finally found one that will charge my phone through my 3.26mm case. To fully test it, I found it can still fast charge through its case while sitting on a coaster (LVP floor plank) 5.54mm for a total thickness of 8.78mm! This wireless charger is very thin and sturdy, made of high quality aluminum, making it easy when traveling. Lights glow green when plugged into power and turn blue when charging your phone or earbuds. It sits on my nightstand by my bed and the lights are not bright enough to bother me when sleeping. I'm very impressed with it and just ordered a second one to use in my office.
","
I had never used a wireless charger before but when I got this Tozo one I was hooked!  Wish I had a phone to use but later.  It charged the earbud case quickly and is as simple and fun as setting it on the list pad and watching the colors change! Well I used it once...the earbuds actually have a long battery life which I love! But one day after learning I had covid and missing the bus at the hospital I had to walk home during which I had my buds in.  I had the case clipped to my beltstrap in the Tozo holder I also bought and at some point the bud case fell out of the holder and I didn't realize until getting home.. I felt too bad to walk to find them and spent next 2 weeks in bed.  I had purchased the extended warranty too which was a waste because the girl said it doesn't cover lost items.  Well the charger is back in the box in a drawer somewhere..the buds with the worthless neoprene case holder thrown on a shelf.  I would advise just throwing the bud case in a pocket or purse.  And I loved the sound..the play time..the ease of use..everything except the crappy case holder and the fact that I have no way to charge and listen to my music...
","
I use this charger regularly to charge my Kindle Signature reader. It charges as fast as one could expect, with a minimum of fuss. Just lay it on top, make sure it’s in the proper position, and go about your business, the device should be charged in a reasonable amount of time. I haven’t officially compared charging times between this and USB-C, but they seem pretty close. I wonder if people who complain about slow charging times have plugged this device into a slow charging unit, or have used an inferior cable. It does take a little bit of trial and error to get a larger device properly positioned, but it’s not rocket science: you quickly learn the basic skill. I’ve been using this for some weeks with no issues. Assuming it holds up well, it’s a good buy.
","
Didn't have a adapter
","
My husbands phone is so old... & when his phone dies, you have to take it apart to reboot the battery.  & the place where you insert teh charger, its loose - so the charger doesnt stay in... which leads to the phone dying. Its a horrible circle of chaos.  I got this for him for Christmas & its PERFECT - no more messing with the cord to charge. Literally, pull out of the box, plug it up - ready to go. I love the color changes on this too making it easy to see if its charging.  I want to get another one now for more rooms!

 I had high hopes for this charger because of the ratings.  I was looking for a new Qi charger that uses the USB-C standard to simplify the number of cables I need.  The charger itself seems like it’s made from decent quality materials and has a nice weight to it.  However, it does not meet up to the claims of fast charging.Before anyone chimes in and says I need “this charger” or “that charger”, let me tell you how I came to this conclusion.TEST ONEEquipment used:• TOZO W1 Qi Charger• OEM Samsung's Super-Fast Charger (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)• OEM Samsung OEM USB C cable (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)Result: The phone displays ""Fast Wireless Charging” but drops to “Wireless Charging” after a few seconds.  As an example, the time to charge goes from 1 hour to about 1 hour 34 minutes when this occurs.NOTE: Also tested this combination with the TOZO supplied USB C cable with no change to result.TEST TWOEquipment used:• TOZO W1 Qi Charger• OEM Samsung's Fast Charger (From my NOTE9)• Known good USB B to USB C cable (New)Result: The phone displays ""Fast Wireless Charging” but drops to “Wireless Charging” after a few seconds.  As an example, the time to charge goes from 1 hour to about 1 hour 34 minutes when this occurs.TEST THREEEquipment used:• YOOTECH Qi Charger (I’ve had it for a few years)• OEM Samsung's Super-Fast Charger (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)• OEM Samsung OEM USB C cable (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)Result: The phone displays ""Fast Wireless Charging” and STAYS in fast wireless charging mode.TEST FOUREquipment used:• YOOTECH Qi Charger (I’ve had it for a few years)• OEM Samsung's Fast Charger (From my NOTE9)• Known good USB B to USB C cable (New)Result: The phone displays ""Fast Wireless Charging” and STAYS in fast wireless charging mode.The above results were 100% consistent and repeatable.  My phone is new (less than 2 weeks old) and by swapping to a different Qi charger, proved both sets of charging blocks and cables were not the issue.  The issue followed the TOZO M1 Qi Charger.Is the charger defective? Maybe.  Is the charger weak and the specifications in the add misleading? Perhaps.  TOZO claim 8mm of separation (gap) is possible for Qi charging, but do not go as far as to claim fast charging is available at that distance.  My NOTE20 Ultra is in a WallSkin Turtle case.  It’s not super thin, but not 8mm thick either.  My YooTech Qi chargers (I have several) ALL can Fast charge thru the case.  The TOZO W1 Qi charger cannot maintain a Fast Charge even with the proper cables and charge block.  I will not be taking my phone out of a case to charge it every other day, that would be crazy.  So this item did not work for me.  I’m speculating that the item I received is defective or to get the thin size corners were cut and I need to have the back of the phone touching the Qi charger for it to work.  I would rather spend a few dollars more and get a ‘working’ Qi charger that meets my needs.I have attached a video to show a sample of the test I did and why I say it does not fast charge.  If TOZA cares to watch and respond to my review, I will listen,  but otherwise this item is going back before the return window closes.  (defective/ not as described) I give it two stars at this time because of build quality.

When I purchased this for myself, I had no idea that I would enjoy it as much as I do!  Its been terrific, so much so that I gifted another to my granddaughter; then a month later, got one for her Dad, my son, who is also raving!.  Well, couldn't leave my two other sons out, so ordered 2 more!  The various colors are nice too!  Yes, charging is slightly slower than my regular charger but to come in and just lay my Galaxy Note 9 on the disc as I go about whatever, I'm spoiled and delighted!  It's not terribly slow, and a full charge will result before very long.  My sons all have IPhones & they are just as well pleased too!  Note: It took me a little time to find ""the Sweet Spot"" in just how to lay my phone on the disc to initiate charging. I found that to lay my phone so that the phone battery is mostly on the disc will kick it into the charging mode, BUT once I realized just how to lay my phone, wa-la!  I don't even have to think about it any more... plop it on the disc & go about my business without another thought.  The charge starts up immediately and will rev a full charge if left a little while...does not take ""forever"", not at all!  Only a little slower....  Was a great purchase for myself and made a terrific, practical little gift as well!  BTW, I bought myself a second one to have on my nightstand. 👍.  Now that I know just how to lay my phone, I oftent wake up in the night; check something on my phone; lay it back on ""my disc"" & sleep away again... SWEET!

Overheats and causes my phone to shut down and displays messge "" wireless charger too HOT"" Bought 2 of them one works fine the other overheats
","
The charger will sometimes ""detect"" a foreign object when there's nothing on the charger. Or when I place a wireless charging device on the charger. If I unplug/replug it tends to work again, but it's a hassle having to do it every time.
","
I keep this on my desk and leave my phone on it throughout the work day > it charges at a good speed and is easy to use. My only complaint would be if your phone dies it takes a LONG time to turn back on with this, but that seems to be a trend with wireless chargers. Super cute color, too!

Takes almost twice the time to charge compared to actually plugging it in. Looks good, and work.

Wireless charger has to be plugged in. I'm thinking no plug needed. Overall, the product is a good gadget.

It’s really good and I love the way it looks! I bought it for days when I’m too lazy to actually connect my phone lol. I just plop my phone on there and let it charge

This charger worked well right out of the box.  I use wired earbuds in my lightning port during the day at work, and it's nice to be able to charge the phone while using it and the earbuds, and not have to unplug the charging part in order to talk with the earbuds.  Charging speed at 10 is adequate for my use. I think that this is a great unit for the price.

Nice wireless charger. But…. The LED indicator lights can be blocked by the phone. So you can’t tell if the phone is charging. Happened a couple of times where my phone didn’t charge but couldn’t see the indicator. Second. The base needs power reset to it more often than it should. The LED will blink indicating an error. It seems they have a newer model out now anyway.

Works as advertised.

I don't think the wattage rating is high enough for super fast charging, but I don't expect to need that if I'm charging over night and I'd rather not cook the battery. Has a hefty bit of weight and rubber feet to keep it stationary on a table.I can raise my phone off the pad by maybe 3/8"" and it still charges with a case on. If you have the wallet protector kind of case, expect that the metal shielding will block it. Magnetic mounting plates will also block it. That is simply the physics of radio waves.People complain about the bright LEDs. The security light on the street probably sheds more light through blinds than this. It's really not that bad.My only complaints are that 1) The glossy surface scratches super easily (my fingernail scratched it while cleaning off tape goo left behind by packaging) 2) The USB-C port is not aligned with the opening in the case very well. It is not easy to plug in.I have only used it for one night, but I don't see anything that makes me think it will fail soon.

This is a great charger, and I don't doubt its functionality at all; it charges my phone and airpods just fine.  But, my pet peeve is that the green lights stay on all the time. If this is in your room, it may keep you up at night if you're sensitive to light (since they're green).  The competitor (ahem) has a light that turns off after two minutes of activity.  In my opinion, that's a superior design choice.  I simply plug it into a power strip now, and switch off the power strip.  An extra step.That being said, it is beautifully machined, it's heavy so it doesn't move on you, and it has some neat circuitry that detects that my pocket knife is not my phone (and it refuses to charge in that case.)  Its design is aesthetically pleasing.It also doesn't come with a power brick that goes in the wall, only a USB cable.  This is fine, they disclosed that in the advertisement.  However, now, I have an extra USB to Lightning cable.  I believe every cable needs a partnering wall brick, and now there has been a disturbance in the force and I need to restore balance.  It's surprisingly hard to find a wall brick from a reputable company (i.e. Anker, etc) that uses the standard USB connector and is a small size.

Works great and looks great in the day time. I just didn’t realize there’s no way to turn off the green lights, but it’s no problem in my office.
","
I am not a fan of this charger. Takes alot longer for my iPhone to charge and sometimes I have to move my phone around on it for the charger to detect my phone. I went back to the plug charger.
","
Don’t have to worry about plugging in and unplugging and cords wearing out fast, just sit your phone on it but for me it takes a couple position adjustments before it starts charging

 Those ads about ""top Christmas gifts""... yeah, I read several of them. One finally convinced me to buy a few products.I'm not impressed with this charger, but it'll do while I'm at the office. I have to remove my phone case & it charges slowly. I have a Samsung galaxy s21 ultra.In our house, we have 1 Samsung, 2 iPhone, and 2 other androids. This charger doesn't work with the Android phones, a Motorola & an LG. Make sure your phone has wireless charging capabilities, which probably should be mentioned in the listing.
","
It’s extremely easy to use, charges the ear buds up really quickly, and it’s convenient! Just set the case on the charger and walk away! Great price also!
","
I have 3 Tozo W1 wireless chargers for my iPhone, and love them.  I bought a W3 for my bed side because of its reduced lighting.  But the little LED is _really_ bright.  I ended up putting some white Elmer’s glue on it (still too bright), and then some white fingernail polish (ditto), and then two coats of brown fingernail polish!  Now it's OK.
","
This charger WORKS but it takes upwards of an hour to charge my husbands iPhone 13.
","
I was amazing surprise on how fast it changes my earplugs. Thank you for your product.
","
Super attractive.  Charges nicely.  BUT, for me, it is not super simple to use.  I expected to be able to set my phone down on it and just let it go charge.  However, you have to set it and center it just so for the charging to work.  There is a light that switches from green to blue to let you know it is working but several nights I set it down and then bumped it, not realizing it shifted off center and stopped charging, only to wake in the morning and my phone was not recharged.  It got to be a thing where I would be setting my phone on it from bed shifting it side to side just looking for the blue light to blink on to indicate it was good to go.  At a point when I am ready to conk out and sleep I am not looking for a precision alignment game to play.  I stopped using it after about a week and a half of constantly finessing it to make it work and just found it easier to plug in my traditional charger.
","
The W6 is a sleek, lightweight charger that looks great on a nightstand or desk. For the fast, premium feel wireless charging at a fraction of the price of Apple's chargers, the TOZO W6 can't be beat. If you want a versatile yet powerful wireless charger that can handle your iPhone and AirPods quickly and easily, I highly recommend grabbing the W6.
","
A bit weak on the powerAlso you can’t turn off the light
","
Well made. Solid performance. Better than expected.

My TOZO W1 Wireless Charger 10W I purchased in November 2022 stopped working.Green light keeps on blinking and doesn't charge smartphones. I've tried different power outlets and same results.I tried the product support link and web page doesn't exist--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Received a brand new replacement in just a week. Great customer service!!!
","
I am very happy with my purchase!I've done a lot of research on various different wireless chargers and I can easily say that the Tozo wireless charger beats all the other chargers based on aesthetics. It is a very slim and sleek look which I am very happy with. It comes in various colors. I purchased gold, which not only matches my phone but also matches my mid century modern setup in my bedroom.I was a little weary about the green and blue light that emits from the charger (green when being unused and blue when charging) because I like my room pitch dark when I sleep, but I can honestly say that the light doesn't bother me and I barely notice it now.When I first started using the charger, it was taking a very long time to charge my iPhone 11 Pro Max for some reason. In one hour it charged maybe 6-7% of battery, which I found strange. I later realized that you have to peel off the little plastic that comes on top of the charger. Even though I wanted to keep it on to give it an extra layer of protection from scratches, I do think that little piece of plastic affects the way your device is charged. Now, I just put my phone on top of the charger when I'm ready for bed, and when I wake up, my phone is 100% charged. It does not charge as quickly as the lightening cord, but I do not find an issue with that. When I need my phone charged quickly, I will just switch to the lightening cord. This wireless charger also charges the Apple AirPods wireless version. I'm sure this charger will have no issue with charging anything that is wireless charge compatible.Not having an AC adapter did not really bother me since in today's day and age you can find an AC adapter pretty much anywhere!This product also comes with a one year warranty which gives me more confidence in the product.Overall, I am happy with the price, the product and the customer service from Tozo!
","
Charges my Tozo T10 but not my S22+, that's why I am giving it 3 stars.
","
Can confirm using 2 chargers it charges at 14W from the wall (tested under 30% battery on pixel 7 pro):1. Amazon basics 65w USB-C charger2. Ipad 20W charger that came in the boxThis is a USB-C to USB-C connection. Specs on back of the tozo say 9v 1.67A which is 15W and my kill-a-watt shows 14W, so basically maximum spec.By contrast with the same charger connected via USB on the phone it gets 21W from the wall with much less heat loss. Charge time will be about half the speed vs plugged in, which I have no complaints.Does create heat, but AIDA64 shows 32C battery temp after 15 mins so nothing too alarming.
","
I was getting extremely frustrated with all of my chargers going bad and decided to get this. Yes, you still need to plug your charger into the wireless charger, but the fact that I can just place my phone on the charger instead of plugging it in was a win for me. I do not like how it takes longer to charge my phone and that is somewhat frustrating. I have even tried using different charging chords for the wireless charger and it didn't change the charge time.
","
Honestly I don't have much complains for this QI charger after using it for awhile. It has a nice slim design and charges my device pretty quickly. I use a quick charger plug in and it works great. QI itself is not very efficient it charges but heat is created between the case and the charger which is not amazing but not fault of the product more so just QI in general.The few things I do think could improve is the fact that the led lights are only on the left and right after using it awhile I noticed my phone covers the LEDs sometimes and it is hard to know what the status is. I would say just have a full circle instead and it would be so much better.Another is the LEDs again are always on. If it were on only able to sleep when not in use it would be fantastic.Finally the issue that it doesn't come with a plug in for the wall to support fast charging is a big problem. I had one that I could spare but without one I would be a little annoyed. Price wise its good enough but without including everything is a downer.
","
It lasted two years almost on the dot 11/2020. Went to put my phone on the charger and it won’t register. Tried unplugging, replugging, left unplugged for a while, different plug, and took off phone case (it worked through the case I had)… nothing worked. Overall, happy with it but idk if I’ll get a pad again.
","
This charger looks great, so much nicer than the clunky first generation black Samsung charger. It charges well, just wish it was a bit faster.
","
It works well and charges my Pixel 6 at about the same speed as a direct connection. The phone does have to be well centered on the device, but there is an indicator light to show when it is charging.It would have been nice to include an AC adaptor with it and an on/off switch would help save power when not being used. I'm not sure how much power it uses when idle, but 2 LED lights indicate when it is on and when it is charging..
","
Great if you want a wireless solution to charge phones. I've used both a Samsung Galaxy and iPhone with this charger without any issues. I haven't been able to charge anything else besides phones using this though. I've tried a Samsung Galaxy watch along with a few different wireless earbuds. None of which have played nicely with this wireless charger.
","
I like that this is very small and compact. Yet it  packs  a pretty good punch for charging your phone!
","
I use these to charge my Tozo T6 and sometimes my phone. Works very well but charges slowly so I leave them charging overnight.
","
This would be a great item if the cable they used was silicone or something flexible. The cable is way too stiff and I can't keep it in place because it constantly moves. Other than that it would be a five star item.
","
This works like a charm! It also has a strong magnet with an extra-long cord. 15W is quite a bit faster than my old one. It's very sleek and looks terrific on my desk! You know right off that it's charging because the light turns blue. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill cheap chargers! Why pay more for something just as good if not better? This one feels very solid and built to last. Of course, Tozo customer service can't be beat. They really stand behind their products. Don't hesitate to purchase. It's a high-quality wireless charger. Highly recommend!
","
This is a solid wireless charger. I've purchased them several times. Yesterday,  the first one that I bought failed to charge my iPhone, instead of going solid blue, the led blinked green and I couldn't get it to charge my device. In a knee jerk reaction, I just bought another one. I couldn't remember when I bought mine, I notice that I get the blinking green when I put my Yeti drinking cup on the charger pad. So I thought that I'd either fried it myself or that it had aged out. Regardless, I ordered a replacement. Imagine my surprise at finding out that the new one behaved the same as the old one. A quick test with a different Qi charging device showed that my iPhone was the problem. I got things straight by power cycling the phone and then changing the battery settings to disable Optimized charging. At that point the phone worked perfectly with both the old and the new charging pads.
","
Works as advertised.
","
This charger works just as expected. I've tried it out on my iPhone 13 Pro Max, Air Pods Pro, as well as my TOZO earbuds. It works great for all of them and charges quickly. No problem charging with my phone case on. The magnet strength is great. The cable has a Velcro strap attached to it to keep everything neat and organized… Nice little touch!The design is very appealing. It is slim and easy to take with me wherever I go. I also love the “black” color option. This charger is much less expensive than an Apple charger and comes with a one-year warranty. I'd definitely recommend you give it a try. TOZO has terrific customer service, I highly recommend any TOZO product.

Bought at the end of Nov. 2020. Decent charge. I would like if it charged at a faster speed like the lightning cable.Wireless charger was easy to set up. All you really need to do is plug it in and it's ready to use.Update 03/2021:It really bothers me now that it doesn't charge very fast by using this. There is a significant difference when you use your regular charging cord versus the pad. Although I am not sure as to whether this is meant to be faster to charge a phone in general, this thing is like a paperweight and I don't find myself using it as often as I'd like.It's still very portable and light, so I would suggest setting this tech somewhere you'd put your phone down often so that you'd at get least some use out of it.Update 12/2021:This product still works. I keep it plugged in on a daily basis to a USB outlet so that it stays on for whenever I use it. It's ideal for overnight charging; I don't worry about whether it will overcharge my phone or not, but like the top reviewers, it is still quite slow as a charger despite how beautifully designed it is.
","
Slow charging only charged phone to 70% after 6+ hours, as it was placed on charger before bed.
","
I received Anker wireless charger for Christmas, so had no need of this one even though it is superior.  This one doesn't care what USB it is plugged into.  The Anker one won't accept a computer nor some other USB chargers.  This one also has a glass, not plastic face.  Much better durability.  Both charge at the same rate.  Neither come with a proper charger, so they are less than ideal.
","
No fuss wireless charger which works with both my Samsung Galaxy S22  and wife's IPhone 13 Pro. Charging speed is excellent. I get fast wireless charging indicator whenever I charge my phone. It conveniently comes with a USB-C cable directly attached to the pad, so you don't need to carry or purchase an additional cable for it. However, you'd need a USB-C wall charger and Tozo has an excellent one which works great with this wireless pad. Overall, it is a high quality product that works out of the box. Highly recommend it.
","
I had it on charge for 3 hours and it charged 40%.  I would not consider it that fast when I can charge it 100% in a couple of hours with a cable.UPDATE:  After this review, the company contacted me and went out of its way to make it right.  Now I am a very happy customer.  Amazing service from the company that provided me with this product.
","
The price is so cheap yet the quality and use of the product is great. Great purchase indeed.
","
I have 3 of these in various locations around the house.  They are thin, and stylish.  The green lights on either side stay on all the time. When the device is charging, the light changes to blue until the device is fully charged.  I haven't had any issues with any of them.  Recommended.
","
I’ve been wanting a wireless charger for a while but everyone I’ve liked had been crazy expensive. I saw this one and read the reviews and decided to go for it. I recently broke my ankle and wanted something by my bed to simply set my phone on to charge. I usually charge it in another room overnight so I’m not as distracted by it. However, mobility is hard right now. The only con is the green light when it’s not in use. It’s bright, as you can see from the picture, it’s brighter when it’s completely dark. The blue isn’t as bright. Love the pink color. Would buy it again.
","
Just plug it in and sit your phone on it and it starts charging.  Not that plugging your phone in to charge is difficult but it's nice to just walk by and sit your phone down on this thing and keep on going.  Pick it up on the go and no wires to get in the way.  We charge our iphone 8S's on it.  Works really well.  Definitely recommend.
","
My kids kept talking about how the iPhone has wireless charging and I didn't quite understand why.  I mean, what's the big deal - just plug in your phone.  I finally decided to get one and try it.  I LOVE IT.  I have it sitting on a stand next to my bed so I just sit it there when I'm going to sleep and it charges. I used to have a cord hanging there that I'd plug in but it was always just a little annoying finding it (maybe it stayed on the stand, maybe it fell on the floor).  It also wasn't quite long enough for me to use my phone in the bed.  If I wanted to use it, I'd have to unplug it, then plug it back in when done.  I know - these are very minor issues but this wireless charger is a good price, and it just took away those minor inconveniences.When I was trying to decide which one to get, this one caught my eye.  When it came, I wasn't disappointed.  It has a very modern look to it and looks very durable.  I love that fact it's made from aluminum and glass and not plastic.  It is also very thin.  The LEDs change from green to blue when your phone is charging.  They also change back to green when it's finished. I can't really comment on the longevity since I've only had it since Christmas.One thing to note - I saw some reviews saying it stopped working.  This charger calls for an adapter that will output 2 AMPS.  The little ones that come with an iPhone are only rated for 1 AMP.  I noticed mine getting very hot and it shut off on me. I just unplugged the adapter from the wall and plugged it back in and it started working again.  Plug it into a 2 AMP adapter and it will work fine.
","
Updated 12/2019 - the most important thing to understand when purchasing a wireless charger is that the rate which matters i.e. watts is determined by your phone not the charger. so if your phone is for example a Samsung S10e your max wireless charge rate is 5W. Even within the same model line there can be differences. My Note10+ has a max rate of 15W so i can take full advantage of this charger's maximum rate but if i had the Note10 I would be limited to 10W. point being how fast your phone will charge using this depends entirely on your phone. when looking for a wireless charger check your phone's specifications first and then find a charger that is equal to or greater in output. as for the charger so far? not a problem, bug or issue.The charger works and looks great with the Note10+.As they state you’ll need an usb adapter to supply power for this device. I already had a 15W charger on hand and used that one. FYI it is a micro usb NOT a usb type c connection. I also used a longer cable for placement reasons.Quality of materials is better than I expected. The center white portion looks like glass but it isn’t. The led lights change color to show you charge status e.g. active or paused/stopped. On the bottom are two rubber pads so it not only stays put but it won’t ever scratch anything either. As for charging time that of course depends on the adapter you use with. That said I was surprised to find that the difference in charge times when my Samsung Note is placed on the wireless charger fills the battery at a rate approximately 2/3 that of the stock charger, according to my phone’s display.All in all I really like this and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to my family or friends.
","
I love this charger!!!  This is the second one I’ve purchased and I LOVE IT !!! Works for ANY phone too!!!
","
Es muy dilatado para cargar iPhone, pero si realiza la carga
","
I’ve bought this a few times and have one in my travel bag and one at work. This is great for charging my wireless headphones as well as charging my phone. Slim and inexpensive!
","
If you place your phone perpendicular to the charging cable you will not see charging indicators (blue lights). Other way phone is not sitting on the pad flat because cable is higher a bit.Pad doesn’t have enough grip on the bottom.
","
This charging pad is large and works great. Unlike other chargers, it doesn't get hot nor damage your battery. Comes with a cable but no power pack which is minor. Plug into any usb supply. Priced very affordable and arrived in a day. Don't waste your money buying one from your phone carrier. Great value and very affordable. TOZO has been an awesome company.

 So I have two phones and both of them are iPhones but only my iPhone #1 will charge. After a few minutes my iPhone #1 and the charger will get super hot.When I put my iPhone #2 to charge a green light kept blinking and it wouldn’t charge. I was really excited for it to finally get here. 😕
","
I really like this, however I feel the colors are a little Misleading because I bought the rose gold and the bottom of the product is rose gold, the top (which I see all the time) is white. Also there is a light that is green when not in use and blue when charging. I have this on my bedside table. During the day the light is unnoticeable. But at night the light is bright. If you dont lay your phone on the charger just right it’s too bright. It can be helpful as you can easily see if your phone is charging but I wish it would turn off when not in use (nothing on it). I do like this though and would buy it again.
","
Title says it all. Oh, the indicator light is sufficient without being obtrusive.
","
Charger always worked as expected, but today, after almost 2 years, I got the “green blink of death.” I’ve tried different power blocks and different outlets. Nothing works. RIP.
","
Works o.k., but two things could be clearer in the product description:1. The light stays on all the time the unit is plugged in (it changes color from green to blue when charging is complete, but remains on).2. The included cable is USB-C to USB-A. The USB-C end connects to the puck, leaving the USB-A end to connect to your wall adapter. If you have a newer-style adapter with a USB-C connection, you'll need a different cable (which you may want anyway, since the included cable is only about 3 feet long, so won't work unless you're placing the charger right above a wall outlet).
","
This works great! I just set my iPhone down on it with my otter box case. It starts charging immediately. The only downside to these chargers is that you can't be holding your phone and charging it at the same time. This one feels sturdy and well made. The material is a heavy metal with green lights saying that it is charging your device. Overall, this is a great product!
","
Handy device with minimal space needed. Not fast charging compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, even using the OEM brick and cable. Works well for my headphones, though. I kept it despite the lack of fast charging because I can just set the phone on it when I go to bed and wake up to a full charge. I also don't have to remove my case to charge.
","
Maybe I'm thick--a definite possibility when it comes to technology--but I can't really see the sense in this.  It has to be plugged in to charge your phone or ear buds or whatever, so what's the point?  You can just as easily plug in your device and charge it directly.  I know there must be more to this than I'm understanding but I'm at a loss.  I got this because I bought some wireless ear buds and assumed I needed it to charge them.  Turns out I don't.  I can charge the ear buds in their case directly using a regular cable and adapter.  So why do I have this?  I'm going to keep it because it's kind of cool and I'm hoping I'll figure it out somewhere down the line.  It charges quickly and works well.  I have an LG Rebel4 so I can't use it for that but that's OK.  Maybe when I upgrade.  Hoping someone will be kind enough to clue this old hippie in on what I'm missing.
","
Perfect size love the thinness. Works great and doesn't take a long to time to charge. Holds charge for awhile. Loved the pink color also.
","
I’m gonna try to charge it without the case tonight to see if it makes a difference, I got rose gold, I love how it looks, I wish the cable cord was longer but I’m sure I have a longer cord around here that will work, it charged my iPhone 11 only 10% in an hour, I’ve never had a problem with charging my phone, I just got this phone a week ago so I know it’s not faulty. So I wouldn’t use this as a “fast charge” maybe an overnight charge, I think I’ll stick to my cord charger if Im on a time limit. But I will give 4 out of 5 stars, I’m taking one off only because the “fast charging” in the title is kinda misleading
","
I love this, but the bright green light that stays on all night is annoying. The unit stopped working already
","
Took 12 hours to get to 89 percent
","
Works fine but as some others have pointed out what's with the lights staying on all the time?  So you can find it in a dark emergency LOL?  I keep it in my bedroom so I throw a cardboard coaster on top of it and problem fixed, but what a weird design choice.  They should just go off after 5 minutes of no use.  It doesn't get hot which is nice.  Otherwise it is cool looking, shiny top.

I’ve had this wireless charger for about two months and I use it approximately every other night to charge my iPhone 11 Pro. It can’t get much easier than setting your phone on a disk — no more fishing for cables or trying to plug in the phone in the dark. The light it emits is pretty bright in a dim room, so on charging nights I set my phone so it covers the lights, and on non-charging nights I simply flip the disk over so the light won’t bother me. The charger generally works consistently, although I’ve learned to verify that the phone recognizes the charge before I go to sleep. (Once in a while, the phone doesn’t seem to recognize that it’s on a charger despite being solidly centered; I don’t know whether that’s an issue with the phone or the charger, but picking up the phone and setting it back down on the disk usually corrects the issue.)Overall I’m very happy with the charger. It’s attractive, minimalist, and of sturdy quality. However, I knocked off one star because the company emailed me after purchase to offer a free second charger if I write a five-star review. To put it mildly, I was disappointed to receive such an email. I really don’t appreciate a company trying to buy five star reviews in exchange for free product. I wish they would let the charger stand on its own merit because it’s a great product and I would have given it five stars.
","
UPDATE: Tozo contacted me and sent me a free replacement that works great. Added two stars. Very satisfied, still find the bright LEDs vaguely annoying but I’m good at positioning my phone perfectly to cover them.I am using the Tozo with an iPhone 8+ to charge it at night, plugged into a quick charge USB plug.Every night I have to unplug the Tozo and plug it back in to get it to charge my phone, basically negating it’s purpose of me just setting my phone on it and going to sleep. I could just plug in my phone instead, and probably will once I get tired of being annoyed by this thing.Once replugged in it will not charge my phone from under 10% to 100%; it usually stops charging around 70, which if I notice in the night means I have to unplug it and plug it back in again and from there most times it still won’t charge all the way to 100 before stopping.The LED lights on it are extremely bright. You need to lay your phone on the charger a specific way at night to cover them, which is fine, but if you wake up in the middle of the night, check the time and see you’re charged enough and don’t lay it on the charger, or put it on the charger at an angle, the  lights will light up your room.It does charge without trouble through my SPIGEN case, and using the quick charge USB plug charges it acceptably fast for overnight charging, when it works, which it barely does.

Works awesome even works through otterbox defender on iphone12
","
Iv had this charger for a little over a month now and from what I’ve learned about it so far is: The outlet I use to charge my device has to be a certain voltage or it will literally take all night. This type charging device is good to use when your phone is at atleast 75% and you want a quick charge to get your phone back to 100%. Right now the charging time is 2 and half to 3 hours if my phone is less that 50%. And and hour to an hour and a half if it’s at atleast 65%. I like the charging pad in itself it has a very nice sleek design but if I decide to purchase another one, it will be one that is specifically designed for an iPhone 11. Oh an not to mention it causes my phone to run hot especially if the outlet I use has poor voltage power, as I said it’s an ok charger but i don’t think it’s compatible to an iPhone 11.

My charging port is wearing out. So instead of spending hundreds on a new phone I figured why not try a wireless charger? My phone has the ability and works great on my brother's wireless charger so.... perfect solution! Well....this charger is a piece of cr**. I've tried it multiple times and only been able to charge my phone once.Issue 1. I keep my phone by my bed because I use it as my alarm. So it's of the utmost importance that it be charged. So the light was a big deal for me. So I chose the option with one little light on the front (not the ones with the two light strips on the side). Boy was the one single light points bright! After waking up multiple times I got up and put some tape and paper over the light. It still shone through but was finally dim enough to sleep. If you sleep with your phone by your bed and need all device lights to be as dim as possible then this product isn't for you. If you like sleeping next to a beacon, then this might be your thing!Issue 2. And, honestly, this is the only issue that matters because it's a CHARGER....it doesn't charge. The first night I had this charger I spent five minutes trying to get it to charge.....moving it around and around and around looking for that sweet spot. Taking my phone case off, turning it up and down, trying different outlets and USB pots, etc. Finally my phone buzzed that it was charging! I had the next day off so I didn't have an alarm set. Woke up to an almost dead phone though. So while I was making coffee I did the same thing. Searched for that gosh darn sweet spot for quite a few minutes (is this how guys feel?). Finally got it charging and my phone got to 100%. Figured the first night must've been a fluke. Nope! I woke up this morning for work to my 4:45am alarm and a notification that my phone was about to go to sleep because it was almost drained. THANK GOD I didn't miss my 6am shift and that my battery made it until the alarm went off. I was furious though because when I had gone to bed I had spent yet another solid five to ten minutes moving my phone around the pad until it vibrated and showed the charging notification. I made sure not to move it once I'd found that sweet spot. I ended up charging my phone in my car on the way to work and got it up to 5% to make it through the day with minimal use. Got home with 1% battery and tried the charger again. This time I couldn't even get it to notify me it was charging after fifteen minutes of once again trying to find that sweet, sweet, sweet spot. I tried EVERYTHING yet again. Different outlets. Different USB ports. Different USB cables. Taking my case off. Turning the phone face side up and face side down. If I'd had some positive vibes left I would've sent those to it as well. Maybe some sage? But nope. I was just full of negative energy about this stupid charging device. So back to the seller it goes! Save yourself the trouble (and anxiety) and buy anything else. I cannot stress how much of a piece of s*** this is.

Excellent product, charges iPhone XR and newer, and every Android we've used it for as well as wireless ear buds. Great design and excellent finish. Liked it so well I have purchased three. All are flawless and work without issue.

They come with a USB cord but you will need to use the outlet plug that came with your phone or purchase one.  Plug it in, drop your phone on it, light will change from green to blue if it is charging.  Once complete, the light changes to green.  Simple and easy.Check the specs to make sure it will charge your phone.  There newer phones (Iphone 14 etc.) will need a different model.

I purchased one in these chargers in the middle of last year.  And I purchased 2 more on December 14, 2022 to give away as a Christmas gift.  My family member and my friend who received them were as ecstatic about them as I was!  It is small, and user-friendly.  I would highly recommend it, seeing I have purchased three of these already!

Easy to use. Not fast charging.

Slim,Fast chargingI like that the light turns blue when my phone is charging and stays green when not in use
","
Great charger!

Easy to use

I the charger didn't work for my android phone. It wouldn't charge it

This charger offers an outstanding bang for the buck!Design is streamlined and tasteful. To the point where it looks cool marinating atop surfaces when not in use. After time spent viewing various chargers on Amazon, I ended purchasing three of these.

The problem: I stumbled upon this product during the 2019 holiday shopping season. I was looking for a way to charge my phone wirelessly. At my office desk, I had tendency to pick up and put down my phone a lot. Leaving my phone with a low battery at the end of the day.The solution: This wireless charger fit my needs, and more. It was a gorgeous, sleek design. I was particularly drawn to the white color with Rose Gold trim. It was very convenient and easy to keep by phone charged throughout my day. I was happy to have it on my white desk over looking at a mundane charging cord. I own an iPhone so I’m aware that a very fast charging speed is not possible. Overall, I was pretty happy with the charging speed this product offers my phone.Sad moment: I really like this product. And I felt a little sad when the product unexpectedly stopped charging my phone. I also don’t want to go back to cords. I now have a very bad habit of picking up my phone and yanking on the charging cord because I forgot it was plugged. For 5 months, it worked perfectly with no issues until now. I tried different methods to resolve this on my own. Now I’ve contacted the company, and I hope to hear back soon.
","
I bought this charging device for my wife so that she can stop using the charging wire and be kinda wireless and she likes it.
","
There are some competitor options that are a little cheaper and look to be of equivalent quality, however I much prefer the minimalist look of the Tozo one. It works exceptionally with no issues. I also have purchased Tozo products many times in the past and they have been very durable despite their competitive pricing. The one time I had issues with one after almost a year they sent me a replacement with zero fuss! Will continue to buy Tozo products.
","
Life saver!
","
Very slim design makes this charger easy to place anywhere and hardly notice it's there. Works well with our devices.
","
Perfect wireless charger to charge anything that can be charged wirelessly. You don’t need to reach for cables or untangle them. You don’t need to plug in your friends charging cable if they have a different plug, they can just put their phone on. I have had this for over a year and it still works great and have not had any problems.  I recommend this if you are looking for a wireless charger.
","
Works like a charm as intended
","
Works great! The magnet is plenty strong with an extra-long cord. Looks terrific too! You know it's charging because the light turns blue. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill cheap chargers! Why pay more where there is something like this on the market? Solid and built to last. Tozo customer service is excellent. They stand behind their products. Highly recommend!
","
These are pretty basic. They are cheap but decent for the money.In my house we routinely charge 5 iPhones and a Samsung Galaxy across 3 of these chargers and generally all functions well. Once in a while a device might need to be reseated as the charging pad will just blink green. We have one iPhone that does this more often than any other but I believe that is due to the magnet case that is on it. Even then, it still usually works.The green light stays on all the time but even when no device is charging the green glow is unobtrusive. The light can be hidden entirely by most devices when charging.I bought fast charging adapters to plug these into but haven’t done any tests yet to check for the time difference with and without the fast charging adapters.All-in-all, these perform well for a pretty cheap price, $10/ea.
","
It is very thin, convinient, and easy to use. I didn't know if it would work with my phone because of my phones case that I put on it, and because it has a metal appearance to it. However, it works wonderfully, and I couldn't be happier, aside from it being slightly larger, and allowing for me to have the option to turn off the light indicators, with a simple night mode switch, so that I know it's connected when I have placed it on the charging pad, but also so that way, I don't seen the blinking of the lights from around my phone all night. I also really like that it doesn't require my Bluetooth to be enable to link with my phone to charge it wirelessly.Overall, it's a great product. There have been those few nights when I woke up in the morning and realized that because my phone wasn't perfectly alligned to the charging pad, it didn't charge. That's why I suggest that it be slightly larger. Also another not I found is that it does not connect with or to an iPad to charge it.
","
Easy to use.  Handy for recharging phones and earbud cases.
","
Great device, that charges your phone fast. I like the fact that it's a little small. I recommend this charger if you want a basic magsafe wireless qi charger.
","
This charger worked well right out of the box. I use wired earbuds in my lightning port during the day at work, and it's nice to be able to charge the phone while using it
","
This charger is very easy to use - simply plug it in and then place your device on it.  You do need to make sure to get the receiver in your device lined up on the charger, so the first couple of times you might have to shift the device around a few times - this is going to happen regardless of what charger you use.When it detects the device, the color LEDs change from green to blue and the charging starts.  The feedback happens quickly - within a half a second, so it's real easy to tell when you have the device correctly positioned.It's a lot smaller than I expected, which is a great thing.  I didn't have to make space to put it on the nightstand - its low profile and small radius make it super easy to fit pretty much wherever you want it.It's also pretty durable.  Its top side has a slick surface (I think it's tempered glass, but don't quote me on that), and so far through fairly average use over 9 months I haven't dented, scratched, or cracked it.  That includes accidentally dropping it 3 feet to the floor a few times.My only criticism is that its status LEDs/lights are surprisingly bright.  It appears the only way to turn them off is to unplug the charger, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a wireless charger.  It's easy to cover them up with a phone while it charges overnight, but if you decide not to cover the phone they are bright enough that in a dark room they can distract from sleep.  Counter-argument: It makes it very easy to see where to place the phone when coming home late and night and not bothering to turn on the room lighting before hopping in bed.
","
I do love this charger. Enough that I have purchased it multiple times. This last time I selected to buy the Grey version as I don't love the light the green bars make at night. They sent me the wrong one, unfortunately.
","
Easy to find the charging spot compared to other brands we own. Bright as hell at night. Definitely not for the bedroom, but would still suggest for desk or counter top. Good price too
","
We got these for our wedding anniversary as well as their earbuds. A rose gold one for me and a black one for the hubby. Its a sweet little charger. Totally portable. I have one of those wallet cases on my phone and it does not effect the charging power for me. I think it charges just as quickly as my cord. I also purchased their wireless ear buds which charge excellant on this thing. Just set the box right on top and they charge just fine.My hubby did not have such good luck with his- although that is NOT the company's fault, its totally mine. I didn't read the description carefully enough. So description IS NOT lying... It does not charge through a metal case. Again. My fault. Not the company so I did not attempt to return. Woohoo! Two awesome chargers for me.Its small enough to fit in your back pocket. It lights up blue along the sides to let you know it's on there and charging. Comes with a little cord, which I found to be a too short, not a problem since it used C cord, like all the newer android devices.I waited over 2 months to post this review so this is time tested- my last one crapped out in less then three weeks.Overall I'm impressed. I also 100% recommend the wireless ear buds from this company.
","
This works well if you plan to use it while you sleep. No matter what charge block or cable I use it will always take 2.5 hours to charge from 15%. Looks good, is slim and seems to be well made. Not a bad product but NOT fast charging.
","
Easy to use
","
Great looking wireless charger. However, the cable is a tiny bit thicker than the charger itself therefore if you place your phone on it a certain way it might slightly lift off the charger causing it to not charge.
","
This works as good as any and I love the design, nice and ""premium"" looking.  I don't rely on wireless charging as my main charging method, mostly just passive charging while working which works well with lower power wireless chargers using it as more a place to just set my phone down.  That said, I rarely find the need to plug into a rapid charger however my phone (S21u) does say ""fast"" wireless charging while on this charger.  I did notice one thing though... it appears that there might be a power saving circuit in this charger where after a certain amount of time without charging anything it will shut itself down.  I then have to un/re plug the charger to bring it back up.  Not a huge deal but something to keep in mind.  I've tested this numerous time but didn't keep track of how long it takes.  Otherwise, for the cost, I now have 7 of these in various locations around the house that everyone uses as needed.  I'm happy with it.
","
I read a lot of reviews of this charger AFTER I had already ordered it.  So, I figured it'll either work great, or be a total POS!This review is early as I just plugged it in for the first time, so it might change over time.  However, for now it's working fine.1.  I read some reviews that said there was no USB cable included.  There was a USB cable there, but as it states, there's no fast charge power adaptor to plug into the wall.  So, if you want your phone charged at light speed, you'll have to buy one.2.  It isn't all that slow on my phone.  I dropped it on the charger at about 81% and my phone says it'll take about 32 minutes to charge up 19%.  Eh, that's fine with me, but again, it's not lightning fast!3.  There are absolutely no lights on my charger disk.  I see where people write that they have these green light on top  of the charger that light up when your phone is charging.  I don't have that at all.  However, our phones tell us if they are charging, so again, no big deal.So that's about it really.  If it actually malfunctions or doesn't work right, I'll update this post.
","
Amazing charger never gives me problems while charging like other ones that it says not compatible or not charging definitely recommended even charges AirPods and Apple Watch
","
Bought this wireless charger to replace one that I purchased several years ago. My old charger wasn't always staying connected to the power source and after recently upgrading to the Galaxy S20+ phone, I found that my phone was very slowly losing it's charge throughout the day when sitting on the pad. I use the wireless charger at work as it's handy to keep my phone charged (or to charge it up if I forgot to charge it overnight) and I like being able to quickly set down or pick up my phone as needed throughout my work day. I've been quite please with this charger. Not only does it look nice, but it does great charging my phone. Not only do I no longer slowly lose my charge, but I find that my phone charges really quickly with this wireless charger. Lastly, my last charger which was triangular-shaped, I had to center my phone almost perfectly in order for it to charge. While you do need to place the middle of the phone on the middle of the charger to get it to charge, this charger seems more forgiving and not requiring the phone and charger to be exact to work.  So far I'm very pleased and would recommend this to anyone.

Nunca había tenido un cargador inalámbrico y este no me ha decepcionado. 10 de 10 en todo!

El producto hace un buen trabajo , tiene buena velocidad de carga y un iman muy fuerte , tanto es así que puedes traer colgando el celular del cable ! Yo estoy contento con esta adquisición

Initial Review:  02/21/2022 - Received this today.  It looks nice.  I plugged it in and it started right up.  About 30 minutes later it stopped working.  I plugged it into several different outlets and it would not come back on.  So, I decided to try the USB type C wire that I use for my phone and it lit right up.  So, the issue is with the USB type C wire that came with the device.  I could not figure out how to contact the seller to see about getting a new wire.  Otherwise, the charging disc seems to work.  If I have any further issues, I will update my review.  If not, then all is well.

Used to work great. Still does. For some reason last couple of days whenever I pick up my phone it gives me a shock.The power turns on. Getting really annoying
","
This is a bare-bones Qi charging plate for under $20, with an esthetic aimed at the iPhone market. It is thin, with a nicely polished glass top, shiny metal bevels, and black (or white) body; the black version looks really good under my (black/charcoal/whatever they called it that year) iPhone X.Charging works fine. This is not a miracle device; you need to place the phone roughly centered on the charging disk. As with all Qi, a few millimeters of non-metallic case are okay, but naked really does work best. Note that Qi charging is inherently a bit slower than through a USB cable, and that's true here as well.This disk comes with a (USB-C on body to USB-A) cable but no charger. Any USB power source will do (Apple brick, commercial charger, laptop, etc.) but to charge at maximum rate you need a 2A (10W) power source. The charger that came with your phone will do. A standard USB port will work, but will charge more slowly.Status is indicated by two illuminated colored arcs on the top plate that turn blue when charging. I don't find them bright enough to disturb me, but they are fairly prominent. If they bother you, when charging to you can place your phone across to cover them. (They are still lit when phone-less.)No opinion on durability yet. It comes with a 1 year warranty (requires registration).
","
I got Tozo earbuds so I decided to get this too. It works good. I have a Note9 and Note10 it works on them also. My tablet it doesn't so check before you buy it to see what's compatible but overall it works great.
","
This is my first time trying one of these, and I am impressed. I read reviews saying it was high quality, and I was still surprised at the high quality! I like how the dim green light turns dim blue when it’s successfully charging. This is SOOOO much easier than a plug when you’re exhausted in the dark… or drunk… it has little silicone grips on the bottom which is nice bc it won’t slide on the table. Definitely pleased w this purchase. I wish my kids tablets had the ability to charge on these! We have gone through 400 broken tablet chargers! I may just buy her a new tablet just to be able to charge it on one of these.
","
I bought the charger for my earbuds and also my phone. The charger charges the earbuds perfect but not my phone when reading the list Samsung is listed and said it was compatible but my phone was not able to be charged by the device. Overall I am pleased with the product with travel size and easy to use.
","
It looks well made it does charge it's very convenient the cable that comes with it is standard USB with a USB C and to plug into the unit itself. I have a OnePlus 9 and the charging unit gets very hot if I leave it on there for a few hours it also makes the phone hot so I'm returning it. As they say mileage may vary it may be different with your phone even if you have a OnePlus 9. Definitely worth the price I just don't like the heat that it generates.
","
Looks great I love how thin it is and it charges my phone and airpods as fast as an apple cable would, I was having some issues with it plugging it into one of my usb-C cables, but then i used it with the one that it came with and its worked perfectly fine.
","
It works really well, even through cases. In fact, I couldn't get my big brand charger to work with my new phone case but this one did.
","
It was good, very slippery so my phone doesn’t stay steady on the platform.
","
I had bought one for myself and I leave it plugged in by my bed. It's so easy to use. I just sit my phone or my Tozo earbuds on it to charge. I love it so much I bought one for my son.
","
Works well with my iPhone though it takes quite awhile to charge it.My earbuds have an issue with only charging one side of the box - could be the box placement bug I have only been able to charge one earbud. They charge fine when plugged in to the wall.
","
.... that was thin enough to put behind it when it was open and sitting on the stand I have it on at my desk, and this worked perfectly.  It's just the right size to fit behind the phone, it hits the lower half which is what charges on a wireless charger (phone works on other flat chargers but usually if it's closed) and I can leave the phone open as it charges.  Works perfectly with a tiny LED on the edge that changes colors to show it's on, or charging or done.
","
I know that with any wireless charger it takes a good while to charge, but this one really seems like it takes pretty long. It sets on my desk at work and when I’m not using my phone I lay it on there. If my phone is pretty well charged, I will lay my AirPods on it. It does a good job in general, just wish it was a bit faster
","
Had it for almost a month now and still loving it so far. I mostly bought this based on the looks and design, and it looks just as good if not better in person on my nightstand. No complaints so far about its charging ability either. To be honest I only use this while I’m asleep, so I can’t say much about the charging speed, besides the fact that it’s always at 100% when I wake up. I see some other reviews with complaints about the phone placement needed for it to charge, but I never have that issue. Yes, there are times when I have to adjust it a bit to make it charge, but as long as you put it mostly centered it will work. To be fair though this is actually my first wireless charger, so I’m not sure how the charging area and speed compares to others. There is also an LED ring that shows if it is charging, so it’s super easy to tell when it is. I might buy another one for my work desk. I got the rose gold which is shown in my picture.P.S. Comes with a decent USB-C cord as well, I can never get too many of those. I do wish the cord was longer though.
","
Very eady to setup, but came with no USB to wall charger connection. However most have a the ohone charger that came with thier orginal phone so it was easy to just swap but maybe it was done to save cost.So I have a iPhone 10, a galaxy s8 and a galaxy s10. Androids charge fast and the iPhone charges just as fast while power off 20 mins from 70% on iPhone and 35 mins of 66%. I also have the tozo wireless ear buds due to a sale and was charged in a timely matter by just placing the box with ear buds inside. Took 1 hr for half of the box power and did felt hot underneath the box, but nothing major.The charger lights are always on with a constant green when everything is charge and on standby and is blue when charging and cannot be turn off however the glow disnt bother me since I'm used to having night lights.Very impressed with the product.
","
I love the slim charging puck and the settle led light from green when not in use, to blue when in use.I have an older charging puck that has abnoxiously bright blue when using. so this change in light is aweseom at night being that it is on my nightstand.I have a case on my phone that contains two cards with zero issues for registering the phones wireless charge capabilities.I would definitely reccoment this product. Remember it doesn't support fast charging, but if you are sleeping what does that matter.
","
An excellent Qi wireless charger for those who prefer aesthetically-pleasing hardware. If you do not want the typical ugly, plastic Qi charging mat with >COMPANY LOGO< stamped on top, then this TOZO charger is likely for you. You get an aluminum and glass disk with a premium design that looks great anywhere.However, those premium looks do not translate to premium performance. TOZO's ""fast charging"" marketing is a stretch, especially for users of late-model Apple iPhones with larger batteries. Android smartphones such as the Motorola and Samsung with Qi charging can allegedly pull more out of the TOZO, but don't expect this plate to charge your iPhone 13 Pro Max from 20% to 80% in less than 45 minutes... and that's with a highly-rated and proven AC adapter built using Qualcomm's QC v3.0 technology.
","
Use at work, carry it in my bag and it works very nicely and quick.
","
This little charger is great for travel or home use. I simply place my phone on the charger and let it do its thing. What is so nice about this type of charger is that you don’t have to unplug a cable if you need your phone while charging. Just pick it it up and lay it back down when you want to resume charging. It also charges my Apple and TOZO earbuds.
","
Excellent price for a non connect charger.  Well packaged item and charged iPhone fast enough without heating.
","
I have one of these at the office, so that when I sit down my phone is on it recharging. Simple, conveninent, and inexpensive. I just plug it into my USB port and it does it thing with no fuss or muss.
","
Bought this for my husband for Christmas and although he wasn’t sure what it was at first, once he did he said it was the best gift he ever got!  It is so easy!  All you do is rest your phone on it .  It works through an otter case as well!
","
Love this product. Exactly as described. Would recommend to everyone interested.
","
Just slap that phone on it and Voilà 😁
","
Sleek design.  Of the same output power as the Apple branded charger, but at half the price.While the cable is USB C like that of the Apple charger, this unit comes with a USB C to USB A adapter to solve the Apple issue of not including an AC Wall adapter with your new phone.  Ostensibly, you’re expected to use an older AC adapter that you have lying around, but it would be very unlikely that most folks have a USB C adapter around.  In reality, it’s another thing you have to buy just to use your new phone or new Apple Magsafe charger.This unit solves this issue by including an adapter from USB C to USB A.  If you DO have a USB C power adapter or wish to use a compatible power bank or computer port, you can still use USB C for faster charging.  In absence of those things, you can actually use your older USB A wall adapter and save the $18 Apple charges for theirs.This unit will charge through an Otterbox case, so I would assume most other cases also.  The magnetic grip is dramatically reduced through the case as you’d expect.  But, it still seems to hold well enough to pick the phone up and use it without the charger falling off the phone.
","
It was really cool and works pretty well
","
TOZO is the kind of company that I want to spend my hard earned dollars with.  Their customer service is the best on Amazon!
","
charging pad works great. I bought this for my wife's new pixel 7 and seems to be working just fine. I don't charge as fast as the 20W plugin chargers, but it isn't important when you want something to charge overnight.
","
Charges my iPhone 11 with no problem. It’s not lightning speed charging but it gets the job done but I realize that my phone gets hot while charging
","
I thought it would work on its own once charged but it doesn't function that way.  Otherwise it works for me.
","
This is a great little charger. From reading other reviews I knew it was going to be thin. However I expected the overall size to be bigger. the diameter measures 3 7/8” which makes this extremely compact for travel yet big enough for your phone to rest on and still see the charging light.There are two colors for the charging lights. Green and blue. The green light stays on when the unit is idle. Blue indicates charging. Even though the light is bright on the charger, the light lines are so thin that it won’t light up a room. You can keep it on your nightstand and it won’t bother you at all.Wireless charging is slower than direct wiring. But not that much slower. I’ve tried it with my phone case on and off. As you can imagine direct to phone is faster than with the case on. However not so much that that it will make enough of a difference that it would chose you not to use the case or use this charger at all. (If you have an armored case like an Otterbox defender it may not charge at all. When buying a new phone case it will tell you if it is wireless charging capable). I have an iPhone XR. If the phone is below a 20% charge it takes about 3-3 1/2 hours to give it a full charge with the case on.The only negative I have to mention, and it’s very minor, is that because of the high polished surface of this charger your phone could potentially slide of the charger if the table it’s on is bumped. If you are using a non slip case it won’t be a problem. But I have a tempered glass case which makes it A bit slippery.Overall this is an excellent charger and I highly recommend it.
","
If you are looking to purchase this item make sure you have a thin phone case that you can put on your phone while charging because when my alarm would go off in the morning it vibrated my phone and it ended up vibrating it off the charger and broke the back glass of my phone😕
","
I like how the light changes color when it is charging and that the light is not overpowering while trying to sleep.
","
It looks good.Very good quality.But. It’s little big(compared with what used)It said 8mm.  But. Not.  It same as other i have(4mm)Finally. It’s good charger
","
This charger isn't anything special, just a nice high-quality 6w MagSafe wireless charge. if you need a wireless charger this is a great one. you can even use the MagSafe with your android if you buy some magnets to put on your phone. would definitely recommend it. Wireless charging is OP and you should get one.
","
The Tozo W6 wireless charger is a fast charger for my phone. I use it to charge my Samsung phones and my earbuds. It's small and fits in a small area. I just place my phones on the wireless charger any time I'm sitting at my table. It's a great product to have.
","
This is a good looking unit that works well with my Samsung phones. I already have 2 of them that I have been using for over a year with no issues. This latest purchase was a gift for a family member that updated their phone to one that has wireless charging capability.

slower charge than a normal charger but its easy to just lay your phone or headphones down and forgetabout it while it charges.
","
This is my third wireless charger from this brand and they work great. Sleek and modern looking.

I love this thing. So easy to use and you don’t have to fumble at night with plugging your phone in; just lay it on top.

Easy to use! Love that I don’t have worry about yanking a cord out of the wall in the middle of the night. Charges very quickly and easy to use, also charges through my phone cover. It does have a light on the side that starts green then turns blue while charging, it is not bright nor does it bother me at night. I have the pink one for reference and I liked it so much I bought a second one for my office. They were sold out of the Pink so I went with the rose gold it is very similar only difference I can find is that the light is on top instead of the side.
","
I bought two of these, one for me, one for wife, for use with new Iphone 12 and iphone 12 Pro.  The chargers are slim and sleek and work well.  Plugged into 20 watt charging brick.  Did not get the apple lightning bolt symbol but they do charge the phones and the charging pad light switches to blue when the phones are charging.  I did not test charging speed.  We use them on the nightstands so fast charging is not required.  iphone 12 pro has a magsafe CaseKoo Slim Thin cover and iphone 12 has a Kate Spade defensive hardshell case which says it ""works with magsafe"" (and it does) but I do not believe it has any magnets in the case itself.I do not believe this charger will work if you have a metal plate on the back of your phone for use with a basic magnetic car mount.  As a test, I placed the metal plate from my previous case/car mount on the back of both of our phones (held in place by the magsafe magnets in the iphones) and placed them on the charges and got the flashing green light, then the charger turned off and no charging occured.
","
W3 is smaller than I thought. Fairly easy to use. Just put your phone on it and it starts charging.It charges Pixel 6 pro. You gain 10% for a little bit over 1 hour. This works for over night charging.

Good charger. Slower than a plug-in by nature, but very convenient for overnight charging. The charging lights are bright, but a phone will cover the lights completely if desired. I travel for work with this, and it's not shown any scratches after 6+ months of going in and out of my work bag.
","
Loving the convenience and appearance of this charger. Using it with a Motorola Edge+ 2022 phone with its original charger supplying power to the TOZO. Works well, just not as fast as a direct charge. I'm thinking that's the norm though.

This is a quick note about my late entry into wireless charging, a little later than many - thought it was time to begin cleaning up the growing array of charging cords cluttering my desk - and taking advantage of what sounds like a great deal.  Fortunately, I also have some wireless compatible devices. The photo shows the charger most of the way through topping up the battery on a TOZO T11 earbuds case. Very nice looking device and pretty easy set up - just plug it in and drop a device on top.  Certainly compact enough for travel as well as for home/office.UPDATE - After about 5 days of use, the charger appeared to stop working. I dropped my star rating (and have since bumped it back up again) and send an email expressing my displeasure with the apparent brief life span of the product.  There was an immediate reply with an apology and a new one arrived by FedEx two days later.This charger is still fairly new, so I can't speak to the longevity of the device, but the customer service setup at TOZO is second to none. This device comes with a 1-year warranty - based on my early experience, seems likely TOZO will continue to stand behind the product.

Sleek charger, but doesn't fast charge galaxy s21. Works well with other phones.
","
It's slower,  obviously, but for the price and simplicity of use, I recommend highly.
","
I got this charger after I bought some Tozo  earbuds that have the wireless charging option. I’m very happy with the overall design and charging capabilities. I don’t have the power block for fast charging but it still charges very quickly with a regular power block! The lights on the charger showing it charging or finished is a great design and not too bright when having it on at night. I highly recommend this wireless charger.
","
I have had several wireless chargers over the years and this is the only one that hasn't stopped working.  That means a lot when its your money.The light ring illuminates blue when when making contact and charging.  If not charging the light is green.  A little different than common sense with the green but you will get used to it.Iphones charge well in their case which is absolutely the most important factor.I am very happy with this purchase.
","
I love most things about this charger. I really love the look of it, it is very slim and modern looking. The build quality is also very very good. It just feels premium, and for being so cheap it is a steal. The only thing I have to complain about is I bought this for the 10w fast wireless charging for my Samsung S20+ and it doesn't work. It only charges at regular speeds, which isn't the worst thing, but it does advertise that it charges Samsung series phones at 10w. When I first put my phone on it it pops up fast wireless charging, but then reverts right back to regular Charge Speeds. Not sure why. If it didn't have that issue I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.

I seem to be collecting wireless chargers. I've got a couple of Yootech, a Samsung one that came with a Samsung 9, a TOZO W1, and now this TOZO W3.First off, I'm amazed at how thin it is. I think of the W1 as thin but this practically doesn't register. It has 4 rubber feet on the bottom so when you plug it in with the supplied cable it still sits flat. Some wireless chargers have the connection so low to the surface where it will sit that the size of the connector on the cable can cause them to wobble. This one sits flat and sturdy.All my devices work perfectly on it including my Samsung S9+ which consistently sees it as a Fast Charger. I'm using the Samsung charger that can with one of our phones. I seem to have a collection of those too!The only other thing I can mention is the power light. It shows green when it is ready to charge but not charging. It shows blue when charging. It's a little light on one end instead of the ring of light on the W1.I looked at some of the low rated reviews. I have not had any issues with the phone detecting it as a non-fast charger. It's worked always. I haven't dropped it yet so I'm not going to test the fragility of it! It doesn't feel fragile to me though.
","
purchased a 2nd one.
","
I recently decided to refinish my desk and after watching a couple of YouTube Videos, which fill your brain with way too many great ideas that make projects longer than they would normally be, I decided to use my trusty router to nest a wireless charger into it. I wasn't sure it would work because there was still going to be 1/8"" of wood in between the charger and my fancy phone, but I was up for it.Attempt number one was a free wireless charger I received for filling out an Amazon review for another product. Works awesome when sitting on TOP of the desk, not so much in my fancy pocket I created for it. Not be be deterred, I decided that free one was probably not as powerful as one I actually paid for, so after doing some reading of existing reviews and obsessing over the specs of how far the device could reach (8mm in this case), I decided on the TOZO W1.Three days later, the charger was sitting on my doorstep and after unboxing it, plugging it in and nesting it in the cool little wooden home I created for it - SUCCESS! Now to charge my phone, I just set it down next to my notebook. Freakin' cool.
","
This device is sleek, polished, and feels really high quality. The one downfall is the LEDs can't be turned off and are always on. Which means this is a great charger for your office but awful for the bedroom.
","
Honestly cool colors and cool slick look and feel. Other than that….it barely works at all. Wont connect to my phone most of the time.
","
nice finish with de glass, very slim, if it would be able to top 15W it ill be perfect!. but works excellent
","
Adding to my old review, with new pics. I purchased a second one for my wife, much easier to see the charging status with the side lighting up!Great charging pad! Love the LED markers to show where it is in the dark AND whether it's charging properly!Other notes:* Suggest you use a (not included) 18~20w power block to get the full effect of fast-charging.* The LEDs turn GREEN to show that the charger is powered, and makes it easy to line up (if you want to out down your phone in a dark room).* The LEDs turn BLUE to show that the charger is properly aligned and powering/charging your phone.NOTE: Over the past few evenings, I have noted that the Blue LEDs will sometimes turn Green in the middle of the night. This MIGHT be because I have ""Optimized Battery Charging"" set on my iPhone 12Pro... I am not sure. But when I pick up the phone in the morning, it's always fully charged so that's what I am assuming!
","
Easy to use
","
Worked great and went to use it today and would not charge my phone or my headphones at all.
","
Sometimes it takes over a minute to get your phone in the perfect position to charge. If you get a text while on vibrate it will sometimes knock the phone out of the ""sweet spot"" leaving you with a dead phone when you wake up. I like the Belkin brand wireless chargers as they are more forgiving when it comes to placing the phone down.
","
This charger looks fantastic. Very minimalistic and sleek looking. Only deducting 1 star due to the fact that sometimes it doesnt charge because I didnt put it exactly on the right spot. Sometimes it will charge but then after I come back it's flashing green meaning that it's not charging. Works most of the time though as long as you actually carefully center it and make sure it's charging before walking away
","
works with smartphone and kindle. Is usbc standard.negatives: non-slip surface collects dust and debris so starts to look unseemly and has to be cleaned often.This is a nit-pick. I'd definitely buy again as this is great value for the money.
","
Easy to read if it is charging by changing colors.
","
I tried with four different Chargers, the ultra fast charger that came with my phone, the fast charging power supply that came with another wireless fast charger... It works there, but does not work with this charging pad. I even bought a qc3 charging brick, still this would not charge fast charge my Samsung.I was very disappointed because I love the design of this one and the look of it, but if it doesn't do what it says it's supposed to do then I'm NOT interested. Basically as soon as you put the phone on the charging pad it displays fast charging for a brief second then disappears and goes back to regular charging displaying a message that says fast charging won't work with this phone.
","
This Charlie pretty good for the price. You gotta make sure your phone is charging before you walk away because sometimes it will just stop. If you drop this thing, I mean just one time, and it’s toast. Done. Won’t work anymore and needs to be replaced immediately. Good charger, just be careful with it
","
The charging pad is sleek and low profile. The lights are green while it is plugged in and turn into a blue purple when it is charging. The lights do not turn off so if you plan to use it in a dark room, there will be some ambient lighting, but it is not overly bright. The plug is a usb plug, and not an electrical plug, but I have it plugged directly into a strip and it works beautifully.
","
It is definitely slower than my charging cord, but when I came up against an error every time that I plugged my charging cable into the port, I knew I had to find a work around. This had the best rating by far, and now I know why. I plugged it into a usb slot on my computer, and plopped my phone on top of it--watched the indicator lights change color and watched the charged percentage tick up. To be clear, it is not a fast charger--it is not going to take you from 50-100% in five minutes. BUT, it works great, is super convenient,  and is a great option if you cannot charge traditionally. I will probably buy a second one for work so that there is a universal charging option for all my coworkers.
","
liked that it is small and seems to charge nicely
","
Writing on directions small
","
Looks super cool. Works great. Love it.
","
Like that I can charge device with case and pop socket attached.  I can also charge other things like wireless earbuds.  I just put it on and forget about it.  Easy to use and it blends in with home decor.  I even got another one for a family member as a gift

My Review for TOZO ""puck"" style wireles charger. Bought this for use with my Samsung note 10+ so I can charge wirelessly. Would buy it again in a heartbeat.If you do your research you know that different chargers charge at different speeds. This is especially important for choosing the right wireless style chargers. You need to know what you are looking for and how to get the correct functionality. In addition to this you have to have a device (phone im my case) that can take advantage of its fast charge speed, some phones can't. Also you have to have your own charge adapeter 'block' that plugs into the wall that is rated for the higer wattage and amps required for the fast charge speed.So, it gets 5 stars for being exactly what it says it is, and doing exactly what it advertized. I do know that Samsung has come out with a super fast charger but its very expensive as of the time I am writing this review. So, do you research and you know hwat your buying.My small rant: It bugs me when reviewers down rate items either becasue of incorect expectations or because of comments on how it could have been better, when they should have know before buying an item. Sure its Ok to comment on other features you'd like or want. But make that part of you review informational (not critical and down-rating) to help other shoppers as they learn and search.I used my plug and usb c cable from my note 10+.
","
works great, easy to use, prices is right.
","
I just received it. It shows all the products it is supposed to be compatible with and that was not the case apparently. When I first used it the message popped up that it was not compatible so it would not charge as fast. Tried multiple devices and still received the same message. We have a few phones and tested them against this and a wall charger and it still longer to charge. I definitely wouldn't buy it again.
","
I bought this to have a charger on our side table next to our couch. The corded chargers we have been using are always giving out and we are tired of replacing them. Both my husband and I have wireless chargers on each side of our bed and we love them. However, we had bought them from our mobile phone provider and they were both over $50 (what were we thinking? Yikes! Why didn't we even consider looking somewhere else first) We didn't want to pay that again, but when I saw this on Amazon, I couldn't pass it up. It's beautiful, which is nice that it isn't an eye sore on my table. It works well, surprisingly well. Both my husband and I were shocked at how fast our iPhones charged. Not to mention, its a great value. You can't beat it. We plan to by another one.We always have phone chargers in our living room to charge our phones during the day and also for our guests to be able to use if they need. We both have iPhones but not all of our friends and family do, so this is nice that it works for any phone that is capable of wireless charging.Make sure your phone is CAPABLE of wireless charging before making this purchase. Many phones are not capable.We love this and would definitely recommend it!
","
I have a Bold N1. Bought 2 of these when my USB charging port went bad and I wasn't going to pay to fix a $199 phone. It arrived on time we'll packaged. These look very nice and work as they should. I really do like the circular light ring that changes color to let you know it senses the phone and is charging. Don't listen to the reviews complaining about slow charging times. These people don't realize that there is a limit to how quickly you can charge a phone by placing it in a magnetic field, and cannot charge as quickly as a high end wall charger. If it did the coil in your phone that converts this field into current would get way too hot. Also you must provide the wall adapter, and the USB type C cable is included. Make sure to use a high quality wall adapter rated at at least the power output required or the charging will be much slower  (no $5 gas station or much older wall plugs because they don't provide enough juice to charge at optimal rates).My phone has a 3000 mah battery. It will charge from 10% to 100% in a little over a hour. Hope this helps!
","
Love this charger to just lay my phone on and charge without having to plug in.  Had to order different cord for it to fast charge that only thing wish it came with.
","
All reviews are accurate, the light does stay on while charging (not an issue for me as I use during day). The charger is quick charging for iPhone not tested on pixel ""yet"". Does not get real warm when charging which is great and a concern I had when buying. I have had this for a few weeks no issues however I always unplug when not in use.
","
The setup was simple, but connecting the charging cable to wireless charger presented an issue... When inserting the USB charging cable into the wireless charger port there was resistance to push the charging cable all the way into the port. When I pushed it all the way down in the port the LED indicator light blinked repeatedly, which the product guide doesn't define what this means. I assumed to not push the cable all the way down into the port, but to stop inserting into port where resistance begins, which stopped the LED indicator from repeatedly blinking a green light to a still green light. My earbuds/charging case and phone was able to be charged. At any rate, the wireless charger doesn't seem to fast charge my phone as it is suppose to. Emphasis on doesn't seem. My observation could be incorrect. Perhaps, I was just impatient. Overall, I do favor the product.
","
I thought this would be a fast way to set my phone down without having to fuss with a cable. Instead, this device requires an equal fuss when setting the phone down on it. You have to put the phone down on the charger carefully without touching the charger itself with your fingers or you risk electrical shock and the charger shuts off. I thought it was a one time occurrence but keeps happening, especially on low-humidity days when I'm afraid to use this thing.
","
I like the fact that you dont have to plug in your cell phone but i dont know how long it takes to charge.  its a good little charger that doesnt take space on your table.  the cord could be longer.
","
First of all, I have to say ""It's so cute!"" - I didn't realize how much smaller it would be than my old charger (see photo), it's literally half the size of my old charger & frees up so much space on my bedside table!  Also, it makes it easy to stick in my purse & use it in my car when I'm on long trips. I took a chance buying, but it does work perfectly with my Apple IPhone SE & my earbuds too-winner!  Tozo always thinks of everything: they even included a ""cord keeper"" that helps keep any extra cord out of the way using a little velcro strap, and they have included a USB C to USB A adapter for greater versatility.  I did go ahead & purchase their USB C Power Adapter because I read it helps speed up the power supply.  What I LOVE is the 1 year warranty that is included - so I feel safe knowing if I have a problem, I'm covered for awhile.  This company has terrific customer service, I highly recommend any Tozo product.
","
I keep this in my home office.  It charges both my cell phones and my ear buds.  Super convenient to have.  Now I want one in every room.
","
So far this charger has been great! No big problems  or issues. The only thing I would say are small hiccups are that it doesn’t charge super duper fast (so if your phone dies and you’re looking for a quick recharge, I wouldn’t use this I would use something faster). The other thing I’d say is that sometimes if it’s not lined up correctly with your phone it might not charge (I woke up once or twice to my phone battery at like 30% because I thought it was charging). Other than that, it’s been super portable and it’s sleek design is really nice! If you don’t like lights shining in your room at night make sure your phone covers them on the charger before you sleep (you can’t change the brightness on the charger).
","
Doesn’t charge as fast as I would like
","
Did not work with my 2 Motorola G4's.  Guess it will work with my Samsung S8Note.(sometimes I like to have an excuse, not to log in.)
","
Es práctico pero carga lento!
","
Charges a little slow but gets the job done for the price
","
I've ordered two of these chargers over the years; and my first one still works as great as the new ones. They work like other wireless chargers, you have to get your phone in the right spot. These chargers seem to have a stronger signal than a different brand I've tried; at least I've had some earbud cases that didn't work well on a different charger but worked great on this one.
","
It's been working flawlessly so far, very happy with it.  I've used it mainly to charge my iPhone and Fire Tablet.  It does not come with the wall power adapter.  It may have shorted the tiny iPhone adapter that I had lying around, which I replaced with a better adapter and it's been working trouble free since.
","
This seems to work okay, but the EMF field (radiofrequency signal) is stronger than my wireless router and could cause some interference (plus it's probably not great for your health if you're in close proximity).  The signal was very strong even 30 feet away which can affect sleep according to studies, so I would definitely not have it plugged in by a bed to charge at night.
","
I love the thinness of this charger and the LED lights that let you know its working.  It is a bit finicky when it comes to placing the phone on the charger.  If it is not centered properly it won't charge.  This is a minor detail and probably the same with any wireless charger.  You can't beat the price as I scored this on for less than $13.  Best bargain on the planet!
","
I bought this based on the thinness of the charger, and I have had good luck with Tozo products. It looks really good when you set it on a table, dresser, counter, etc. Charging works fine, and it does what a charger should do.
","
I bought this for my Samsung S22 because it claimed to be fast charging. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I tried 4 different fast charging adapters, both QC 2.0 and 3.0 and ended up with the same result.  It will say fast charging for a second, then switch to standard charging. This really didn't bother me until I had about 15% battery left and my phone said it would take 3 hours to charge.As far as the looks of this wireless charger goes, it's beautiful! It looks lovely on my nightstand, and is perfect for travel. I also really like the light cues so you can tell when it's charging. The lights aren't bright at all, which is great if you can't sleep with light in your room. If you don't care about fast charging, then I definitely recommend this. However It's a deal breaker for me that it takes 3 hours to charge on really low battery.

TOZO for the win!I have been reviewing TOZO products for around a year or so, they send me something and in return I give an honest review. This is the third charger I am reviewing for them and honestly, after the last review I thought they’d never use me again. It wasn’t good, but this charger changes things completely!First off, I’ve never been a huge fan of this type charger, you have to leave your phone alone and can’t use it while it’s charging and that does no good through the day, but this charger has magnetic ability that changes that. It will attach to your phone and let you play with your phone while it charges.Secondly, it charges my iPhone 11 Pro Max stupid fast! Easily as fast as my plug in charger.Lastly, it looks and feels great. This thing is solid and built for the long haul and on your desk or night stand it will look great!The bottom line, this charger hits all the buttons that the competition lacks. Half the price of Apple’s with all the quality and looks meriting a much higher price. Make your wallet happy, get this charger!TOZO for the win!
","
This charger is easy to used and a great way to charge your phone.
","
I just received this product today and I mostly bought it so that I could finally have a wireless charger for my iPhone 11. Upon placing the phone onto the charging pad, it took up to 10 seconds for me to find the right placement for my phone to sit onto the charger. And I am not even sure if it even charges my phone being that I had my phone on the charger for over 30 minutes and it stayed at 74%. As for charging my T12 headphones they worked perfectly well and charged relatively fast.On top of that, the product does not look exactly like the pictures from other consumers nor the pictures provided from the company. The box and other pictures shows that there are two curved LED lights on the top, but my product came with one small, tiny circle LED light on the side of the charging pad.Due to these features and lack thereof I am returning the product.
","
I found this really sleek and elegant, but had a few reasons that I won't use it as often as I'd like.Pros:- easy to fast charge- immediate charging- Nice and compact- easy to find a place to put it- looks niceCons:- Would not charge through my phone cover, so I have to remove it to charge- After a while of charging my phone slides off the charger even on a flat surface- to get a full charge I need to check it and make sure it remains on the chargerEDIT: I was able to get it to stay on the charger so now I use it and it fast charges well, but I must remove my phone cover. Apparently my shelf was not level. I pulled out a level and discovered this, so I moved it to a level place and it worked.
","
Saved us so much money!  Not ready to trade in phones, but charging port was weak. In both phones. So bought one to try. Success. Bought a 2nd one for hubby. Happy. Asked to order a 3rd so he has one by his chair, & one by his bed. All great!
","
I'm not sure if it was the delivery or just packaging but the box came opened, I did not order it used. It had a bit of dust and scratches on it but when I cleaned the dust it looked good, only a few tiny scratches. Otherwise its very thin and beautiful. I would recommend buying it new.
","
I just got this charger a couple of weeks ago. It works fine and is a really nice looking item. It looks just as good as the pictures. You can place this anywhere in your home. I don't normally give an item 5 stars after using it just a couple of weeks, but this is such a great value that I made an exception in this case.It charges fine, but I only gave 4 stars for charging power because I have not made the time to note how long it takes to charge a phone fully. I know charging time is something that is very important to some people (not me) so I was hesitant to give 5 stars. It just works.I suppose this would work just fine for travel, but I use a regular wired connection when I am traveling, hence the 3 stars for travel.Finally, in the interest of full disclosure, the vendor contacted me after I registered the charger and told me they would send me a free one if I wrote a review. I would never write a misleading review just to receive a free item--in fact, the opposite is true: I would have written a scathing review if I thought this was a poor product and the seller had made such a request. And, I would not care if they sent me another if I were dissatisfied with the item in the first place. I am not receiving monetary compensation for this review. Now you know, and you can make of this review what you will.
","
I got this charger as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It DOES come w a charging cable, but you need to plug into your own charging cube.  I thought it was sleek, and would be accessible for anyone to use, as my husband has a small “desk area” set up in part of the kitchen. I didn’t realize just hOW convenient it would be!!! As your phone is just lying on the pad, it is so much easier to pick it up to make/answer a call, etc, without having to unplug the phone!  We liked it so much that we got 4 more: one for each of our nightstands, one for my husband’s workshop, and one that I bring with me, if I travel to my Mom’s.  It is sturdy, sleek and attractive. I saw a review that highlighted the lights on the glass disc. They are terrific (let you know when your phone is completely charged), but they don’t cause sleep disturbance: Just turn the phone so that the lights lie under the phone when you are charging your phone overnight.  Great price for a quality product.

This is a very nice quality wireless charging pad, I bought the silver with the grey silicone top.  Out of the box you can see that this is well built all aluminum except the silicone pad and has some heft to it.  It measures 4 inches in diameter and has a small single LED indicator at the front that emits green while plugged ready to go and blue while it charges.  I chose this particular unit due to it having the grippy top and the smaller LED footprint, I didn't want the light show or have my iPhone slip off the pad.  Regarding the LED it's a pretty bright green for a single emitter I couldn't have this sitting on my nightstand next to my bed, but I prefer pitch darkness while I sleep YMMV.  The blue light while it's charging is definitely more tolerable though.  Although I can't comment on its fast charging capabilities, I use a standard 5w brick, it charges just as fast as using a cable with the same adapter.  My preference is to use this with the 5w adapter just to cut down on heat and possibly extend the battery cycles.  I don't need fast charging capabilities for my needs, but I guess it's nice to have it available in case my needs change I just can't review that part of the device.All in all I am very happy with this unit and have been using it daily for close to a month now without issue. I would definitely purchase another TOZO if another was needed.

It's the middle of 2022, and I bout this in 2020 and it works just as good as when I bought it.

Bought the black version.  Exactly what I expected from the description.  Using an Amazon Basics single port 2.4A USB charger to power my new W1 wireless charger and it works fine.  Using with a Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus 5G inside a case and it charges the same in or out of the case.  Does not fast charge nor super fast charge my S20 but that is fine for me since it's on a bed side table for overnight charging.  I like the LEDs on top that light green in standby and change to blue during charging.  It's small flat size will make it easy to pack in any bag and take with me on trips versus my Samsung standup version that doesn't fold closed.  It's a little touchy about the phone position and will indicate charging while the phone is not being charged, just make sure your charging indicator on your phone says it's charging before leaving it alone to charge.  Probably buying another for my wife.  So far, I would recommend it to friends.

works well, I'd buy again

Slap your phone down on this thin mint and BAM!! Blue light let's you know power is a go! Dig it!
","
This device worked pretty good. It's thin, stylish, easy to use. Got it going, slapped my phone on it, power light showed charging, and away we went. Nice here are the rubber feet so it doesn't slide.  A few negatives and why it only got 4 stars... when it's plugged in and not charging there is a soft green light on. If you use it at night might bother some people. It comes with the cord but not the adapter to plug into the wall. Granted, if you're like me I have adapters crawling out the drawers, but if you don't and are looking to put this in an extra area, won't work. But my biggest complaint is that it really isn't a quick charge for what I'm use to. It sits in the middle. I'm use to 60 minutes from dead to full... this is about 90 to 120. It's OK, but not what I was hoping for, but for 10 bucks I can't really complain.
","
Bought a wireless charger for roughly the same price ~3 years ago. Decided it was time for an upgrade. This charger was definitely worth the pennies it cost; whereas my last charger was very sensitive for where on the pad you had to place it, this smooth large surface is much better about charging area. Also the smooth surface is both nice and overall very aesthetically pleasing (and a pretty solid build). Huge plus is this runs on USB-C unlike many wireless chargers still on the market, and this has a good charging speed (haven't done precise measurements, but significantly faster than the last one I had).
","
I got this as a gift for husband and he loves it. Charges through his case, which is pretty sturdy so that’s definitely a win. I would absolutely repurchase.
","
Not only is it not a fast charge (as stated) my phone would heat up after 10 minutes of charging. And the indicator for charging just flashes.
","
Got 2 of these, one was DOA but the other was fine and still works 2 years later.  As long as it works straight out of the box I think these last a long time.
","
Well made and looks nice on my bedside table. Works well as long as you make sure you place your phone on it centrally and see the blue charging light. Took me a few tries to get used to that but easy enough.

 I bought this wireless charger about 2 weeks ago, and I’m already so impressed with the way that it works. This is the first wireless charger that I bought, and it is awesome. I currently have an iPhone XR, and two pairs of Tozo Earbuds (Tozo T10 and Tozo T12), so I use this wireless charger to charge all of these. I love how the wireless charger is so thin, shiny, elegant, and portable! The charging power is fantastic because all my devices charge so quickly and efficiently. There is a green LED light when the wireless charger is plugged in, and then it turns blue when it is charging something, so that is a great way for me to make sure that my device is charging. The USB cable is nice and 3 ft long, so I can plug it in from a distance, and there are four rubbery feet that give an exceptionally good grip on any surface. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless charger that has a great charge time, efficiency, and a fantastic outer appearance. Getting these many great features and such great satisfaction is very rare, but I have definitely gotten it with the Tozo W3 Wireless Charger!

Small compact 10 W wireless charger. I like how it attaches to my iPhone magnetically.  Easy to travel with. It never gets hot. I also use it to charge my Amazon Fire tablet 8 Plus and 10 Plus.

I have been searching for a cost-performance wireless charger, and I think I finally found a solution. I needed something that I have a small and slim profile, not too much of IT looking design, and be able to use my existing USB adaptors. TOZO W3 wireless charger met all my needs. 3.5 inches of diameter and thickness of 0.19 inches is small and thin enough to feel like the product is a built-in charger when it is placed on the desk.One useful tip that I found out. A small LED in the product will lit in green when the product is connected to a USB. If the LED blinks in green when a phone is placed on the charger, that means either the USB port is not compatible or your phone is not properly placed. If this happens, try to connect to a different USB port or slightly adjust the position of the phone. When the charger is working, the LED will lit in blue. When the charging completes, the LED will lit in solid green again. If you need a cost-performance wireless charger with an esthetic appeal, I believe this is the product you will love.

I purchased TOZO W1 Wireless Charger Thin Aviation Aluminum Computer Numerical Control Technology Fast Charging Pad. It’s thin and attractive!We used it to charge iphone 12 Pro Max as well as iphone X. We have the following issues:Charging very slow on iPhone X  3 hours charging only 22% ( 32% to 54%) much slower than regular off-market wire charger. My husband tired of waiting took it off the pad and plugged in the charging cable which took 2 hours to reach 100%!!  Charging is inconsistent with iphone 12 Pro Max.  From 79%  goes down to 75% in an hour.  It takes overnight  from 75% to 84%.I believe something is wrong with the charger, it is definitely not fast charging if it charges at all.  The blue light on the pad does go on, the green charging light does not always stay on the iphone, it goes off sometimes and adjustment is needed.I reach out TOZO customer service but not helpful back and forth 5 times insisting I get an AC adapter 5V / 2A I did use the original specialized USB cable(come with the charger) , didn’t use off brand cable and adapter. As TOZO indicated other cheap usb cable/ adapter may not provide sufficient voltage to the wireless charger.Sounds like my Apple original AC adapter not good enough. There’s nothing  indicated in the description that 5V / 2A AC adapter is required for it to work. I really wish it could work as there’re many good reviews but disappointed and frustrated. I will just return to end all the frustration.Update:I bought an AC adapter 5V/2.4V for this charging pad, the charging speed improved but still only 65% overnight. I shared the outcome with Customer service. They believe it should be faster than this and compensate with partial refund.  I added another star for positive customer service.

The ambient light from the charger is a good addition. Easy to locate for guests.

This charger works just as expected, and charges quickly. I've tried it out on my iPhone as well as my earbuds, and it works great for both. It charges quickly, and it's still able to charge with my phone case on. The design is very appealing and the color (black) matches my phone very well. I haven't had any issues at all with it. It is a type c charger, and it works perfectly with TOZO's type c power adapter. If needed though, it comes with an adapter so you can still plug it into a regular USB adapter. It is slim and easy to pack with me when I'm on the go and may need a charger. So far, it seems to work much better than chargers I've had in the past, but only time will tell. I'd definitely recommend you give it a try. At half the price of an apple charger, I'd definitely say it is worth it. Also, the option to have black instead of white is definitely a huge plus.
","
My only complaint is that this charge does not charge my apple EarPods case. Other than that. This is perfect. I use it for my work desk and it is very sleek and cute!
","
I really like the size of this charger — roughly 2 inches in diameter. This makes it unobtrusive and great for use in your vehicle. It seems to charge just as fast as my larger chargers. There is only one problem (in my opinion) with this device and this may be a personal preference. It has a power cord permanently attached. I would much rather it had a built-in USB port (mini-USB or USB C) to plug into existing cables in my car, office, and on my living room coffee table. For me, plugging and unplugging cables at the power source is a major pain — especially in my car where I need needle-nose pliers to reach the USB ports. If it had a USB port I could easily just drop it in my pocket and take it with me and plug it in to existing cables wherever I am.
","
The first thing I noticed, was that when I put my phone on it, if it did start charging, there was quite a delay before it started. If I didn't have my phone in exactly the right place, it never did start charging. I went back to my old charging pad, with the same power supply, and it worked fine. Plugged this pad back in, and got the same poor results.
","
I really loved this charger when I first got it, it was able to fast charge both my wife's S8 and my S9+. Placement is not so finicky like other wireless chargers, and the lights on top which turn blue when charging are very nice.I recently upgraded to a Z Flip 3 and while it still charges it, the phone notifies me that Fast Charging is not available with this device.Still a nice charger, but I'm hoping to find a similar designed device (aluminum case with charging LEDs on top) which will support newer phones.
","
I could only speak on the last couple weeks with it.  So far it works great! Set your phone or earbuds down on it and it charges.  Takes the same amount of time as a regular charger would.
","
Large charge pad, seems to charge at a fast rate. I dont need to aim the phone like i do with the other wireless charge devices with the smaller pads. Easy to use and looks great.
","
Works great! And I can’t hear the electric current in this one like others.

 I bought this charger in April 2021, it has served me well but today might be its last day. I usually leave my iPhone on it overnight and it charges fully by the morning, so if you’re wanting a fast charge this is not it. When I had a pop socket it wouldn’t charge through it either so I always had to remove my phone case but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me.Today for whatever reason it began to blink green, which usually indicates an incompatible device or some issue blocking the charge but my phone wasn’t even on it. I unplugged it and reset it but nothing changed, so I guess this is it. However, I’m not that upset because it did last over a year for me, and was convenient and didn’t break the bank.
","
I bought this for easy charging but unfortunately it doesn’t work, or isn’t strong enough, to charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I now just use it to charge my AirPod pros, which it works fine but you have to line them up correctly. Love the simplistic design
","
Didn't know the phone won't charge if it's less than 20%. My husband and son always run their phones almost to zero before they think to charge. Other than that works fine.
","
Almost never starts charging, even when the pad is lined up correctly.  Yes, I have a phone case on, but it works on my other 3 wireless charging pads/stands/car-charging-cradles with no problems.
","
I bought two.  My phone can't be placed randomly on the pad, but I quickly learned where to set it to start charging. It does have green led arcs that are On all the time. I thought it might be too much light for sleeping, but it is not.  I place the phone on the pad to cover the lights and no problem whatsoever.  My wife's phone has a thick case, but it is not a problem for the charger.  At this price, I may by at least one more, because I assume at some point, it will fail. Wasn't sure about the color; it looked metallic in the photos, but the chargers I got were white, just like I wanted.
","
I love the design of this product. I bought the white/gold and it looks great on my nigh stand. It's very thin and small in size, sleek. However, I was surprised when I plugged it in how bright the lights are on it. They stay on all the time, making it not look very beautiful. I wish there had been a photo showing how it looked with the lights on (all the time) as the product is a bit misrepresented. I can see from user photos the bright lights so I should have paid attention. For the price it's still a great buy and use it for travel or something but ultimately I will replace this item with something not so bright for my bed stand. I don't like the look on the lights on all the time as it looks too techie and I don't want a bright light by my bed when I'm trying to sleep. Disappointed!
","
Technically the charger isn't wireless - you still need to plug it into a USB port.PROS:-works with my iPhone WITH a case. I have a slim Ninja Wallet with several credit cards and while other wireless chargers have not worked (due to the extra distance from phone to charger), this one did! I was surprised and very happy.-works with my airpods pro.-looks great-niceCONS:-charge rate is slower than charging via plug (tested on iPhone 8)-charge rate is also slower than other wireless chargers I've had (ie., Anker 10w charger)I'd recommend it for anyone that has devices they want charged without the extra cables. Aesthetically, the charger is glossy, with thin led lighting that's also functional (green=ON; blue=charging; blinking=not charging).I'm happy with it. I wished the charging was faster but as it sit in on my office desk, I'm ok with a slow charging if it means I don't have to have as many cords.
","
I originally bought this wireless charger for my son for a Christmas gift, turns out his phone does not support wireless charging. Totally my fault for not actually looking up his phone and just assuming. So I decided to save the hassle of going through the process of returning this item, and just use it for myself. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max, with a simple thin plastic case on it. I have gotten this wireless charger to work ONE time for a total of 15 min with my phone. It will not charge, I have even taken my case off just to see. Yet all I get is blinking lights and no charging feedback on my screen. Save your money and go with a better charger. This thing is junk.**Edit**The company reached out to me regarding my less than satisfactory experience with their product. They have wonderful customer support and if you have any troubles with their products they will go above and beyond to make things right for you. Awesome seller, just received a defective product in the beginning. All is well now!

 So apparently this is supposed to charge airpods as well but for some reason my airpods this wireless charger does not work with my AirPods. Also, apparently this shows you when your phone is fully charged but it does not. When I checked my phone it was already at 100%, thinking that it was still charging since the blue light indicates that it’s charging. Additionally, earlier today the light was flickering from dark blue to light blue which idk what that means. It does charge your phone quickly though.
","
Works as advertised. very thin and USB type C interface.

 I bought this for my office desk and totally love it, it’s cute, and it works great with both my i8 and my i13! My i8 even has a thick case and a pop socket and it still charges!  Green light means it ready to charge, and blue light means it’s charging!  I was skeptical with the price but I will definitely be ordering a few more for around my house! Convenient and way prettier than the others I have!
","
The product is very sleek. I really like it expect for the fact that is the slowest charge ever!
","
I don't like a lot of light at night, and I like to charge my phone nearby, so this pad is pretty handy.  There's only one small LED on it to let you know it's charging, although it is WAY brighter than it needs to be.  Nonetheless, it's still far less-intrusive than most wireless chargers out there these days.  Most manufacturers seem to think the more light they produce the better the product.
","
Looks good and charges well. Not quite as fast as direct connection,  but good. One slight negative is it makes a high pitched buzz when not charging.  It's about at the upper limit of my hearing, but annoying enough that I unplug it when not charging since I keep it on my desk.
","
This seems like a good charger and it is delightfully small and unobtrusive.  It does what it promises.  My greatest delight is that I don't have to slide my phone all around until it connects and starts charging.  With this the phone can just be placed on it without any fuss and it starts charging.It is disturbing that the barcode to activate the warranty brought me to some sketchy sites.  Then I tried to do it with the website they suggest and got serious messages about its being an unsecure connection.  I didn't try any more but doubt I'll feel comfortable purchasing any more of their products.
","
I like the charger. Small and functional. I charge my phone and my ear pods. It’s great.
","
Bought 2nd one due to Lightning Deal as I loved my original one.  Simple and elegant, especially with the lighting that allows me to know when it is charging.
","
This charges an iPhone SE faster than a well-known charger my wife purchased. My only issue with it is that the usb-c socket is very shallow and not stable. It will sometimes lose its connection and stop charging. I have found the “sweet spot” for placing the phone to be quite forgiving, but the whole setup must be positioned just right to keep charging.
","
It charges my iphone 11 pretty quickly. It’s very affordable. It obviously does not have to connect by wire to my phone so it relieves any problem regarding connectivity since you simply lay your phone on it any time you want to recharge it.
","
Wish I would of known how bright the little charging light was! It can be rather annoying when trying to go to sleep and it’s on your nightstand. If that will bother you, do not buy this.
","
Great design and execution.  I like that it uses usb-c input so I already have cables and adapters, and it includes a cable.  charges at a good power level.  The color LEDs make it easy to find in the dark and change to blue to let you know the device is correctly placed and charging. Slim size packs well. My phone's usb port wore out so these will let me delay the phone replacement.
","
I've just discovered wireless charging with my new iPhone SE and I'm totally hooked on it.  I've bought several different charging pads, and this one wins hands down.All the others required the phone (with case) be just right or either the phone would not start charging or, it would stop charging soon after it began. Not with this one. I don't know how they did it but, I can just plop it down kinda sorta in the middle and I hear the charging chime. It amazes me.  credit cards preventing it from working. I have my license and 2 cards in a smartish case and no problem.  Once you discover wireless charging it's a huge game changer.While in the dark bedroom you grab the phone to check on this or that, it's dark but there are some very cool lights that let you know where to lay it back down. They don't interfere with sleep and go out a few seconds after connected to the iPhone. Not sure why Apple hasn't promoted this feature more than they have. It seems charging is a never ending battle with smart phones. No longer. If you're in need of one buy this one!
","
It works really well with my Samsung phone. Most importantly, I don't need to take the phone out of its case to charge wirelessly. It is very convenient. The wire is also long enough for my office and bedroom.
","
So I bought this to help end my issue of having all these charging cords laying everywhere on my nightstand! I have 2 cell phones (one for work and one for me) and my ear buds that can be charged wireless. The problem is they all take different cords to charge them. Now I just set them down on this magical device and boom!! Charged phones and ear buds!! No more cords!! All my devices charge quickly and do not get hot like other wireless charges have done to them. I have both phones in Otterboxes and this charger has no issue with that. Others I've used required I remove the case first. And at just over $10 this is a bargain!! I am quickly becoming a fan of Tozo!!
","
Very handy little charger. I have an Apple 13 phone and this charger works great. I like the small slim form factor.  I have the 2 previous versions of Tozo chargers, and this is my favorite so far.
","
Couldn't find a description of what the different LED lights mean while charging but it works very well and didn't take long to figure out.
","
I gave it 4 stars because it doesn’t come with an adapter.
","
Charger works ok but due to lack of any abrasive surface on the charger, phone slides around a bit. Not a big deal usually but the charger has to be perfectly centered on this charger or it won't charge. Guess I can us it as a coaster.
","
When you have something on the charging panel, it seems to get hot when it is charging.  Don't think it is getting hot enough to do any damage, but it is warm to the touch.  May lead to problems if it gets hot and definitely not something I would be comfortable leaving plugged up like some other wireless chargers I have used in the past.
","
I bought this because I thought it was needed to charge the TOZO earbuds. Turns out that the earbuds can be charged without it, but still glad I got this. It is my first use of wireless charging. I simply use the provided USB cable to connect to my laptop. My TOZO earbuds charging case, then can be placed on the charger as needed. The first time I used it, the charging case was about 85% charged and it only took a few minutes for it be fully charged. It looks great and the lights on the charger will show if it charging. I placed an old Samsung phone on it and as expected, the phone does not support wireless charging, which was confirmed by the lights on the charger. It does not come with an AC adaptor, but that is not a problem for me since I am plugging it into my laptop and I have to many adaptors already in the house. Very happy with this purchase.
","
I bought this recently because my TOZO earbuds case had stopped charging due to some damage where the cord plugged in. I was going to just order a new set when I was checking and found that they were wireless. I decided why not. The price is great and I really didn't want to have to order a new set.The charger comes in a slim box with no frills. Charger and cord. Pretty much all you need. The directions were simple and to the point. The only thing that doesn't come with it is the AC adapter. Not a big deal because I must have 10 of them in a drawer just like most of us do these days. The no adapter is actually something I like as it means the box is slim and easy to carry.As you can see from the picture the design is slim. I almost put my coffee cup on it because I thought it was a coaster for a minute.It easy to use. Plug in, either with adapter or into a usb port on your laptop or desktop and let it charge. I fully charged my earbuds in about an hour and a half.All in all I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone. It can charge phones as well so its a win win if yours can be charged wirelessly.
","
I love this wireless charger.  It is so much more convenient than having multiple cords for all of my devices.  It charges devices really fast and looks nice when not being used.  Very small and lightweight so it is easy to pack and take with you when traveling.  Look no further if you're in the market for a wireless charger.
","
I really like this charger. I have several different ones in the house and have tried several different ones in the past and this is my favorite.I got the gold one. It has a super clean look which is a bonus for me. It’s a great size, not too small and not to big.3 things I really really love about this wireless charger. 1st- there is no “sweet spot” I’ve had issues in the past with previous charger where I had to place it in just the right spot to get the charge activated- I don’t have that problem with this one- pop it right in and it charges, no matter which funky way it lands. 2nd. I like the green/blue lighting that indicates when it’s charging. Just toss it in and there you go. 3rd. While it’s sleek and thin, I like that it has a bit of “weight” to it. I put that in quotes because it’s not actually heavy or anything, maybe it’s the design of the shape and the pairing of the grip strips on the bottom.  Whatever it is, This prevents it from sliding and moving off my nightstand when I’m searching for it in the dark or when I accidentally tug in the cord. I’ve had numerous incidents with previous one’s where one little tug or tap and it has disappeared under the bed.Would definitely purchase again when I need additional ones.
","
I bought this wireless charger because the charging port on my phone broke and I was hoping to charge it up wirelessly however the minute I laid my phone on the wireless charger the steady green light started blinking which from everything I read means it's not charging. I ended up trying four different phones and two different tablets and this charger did not work on any of them so I don't know if the charger just didn't work on my items (two of the phones and one tablet belong to my sisters) or if the charger is defective because when I read the directions it says when you place your phone on the item the green light comes on, however with my charger the green light comes on the minute I plug it into a wall outlet and then starts blinking the minute I lay anything on it. The charger was only $13 so to return it would have been a bigger hassle than just writing it off
","
If your charging port is obliterated, this is a quick fix.
","
This unit charges, but contrary to product description is not a fast-charging solution. I have tried it on Samsung S20 Plus and Ultra phones. It functionally works and looks nice (not cheap-looking) and for the price, it is acceptable. It simply promises more than it can deliver.
","
This is an excellent implementation. First, the device itself is attractive - extremely low-profile, with a metal body and nice arc-shaped lights on both sides of the platform that let you know when the device is powered and when the phone is charging. Nothing out of the ordinary; just very well-executed, and gives a sense of quality when you handle it.Last, and most importantly, it does maintain 100% charge on the phone. I've used other wireless chargers that charge the phone to 100% then stop charging; so, overnight, just by idling, the phone will discharge. This works perfectly. Whenever I pick up the phone, it has 100% battery. I have an old Samsung wireless charger that does the same, but they do not all do this.Overall, highly recommended. Plug it in to any USB-C cable and power supply and you're on your way. I am in fact buying two more of these to keep around the house for my family to use as well.
","
The only reason for the 4 star review is because it won't charge with a magnetic dash mount attached to the phone.  The magnetism in the plate interferes with it and won't allow for charging.  I took the plate of the phone and it charged perfect though.  Good charger other than that.
","
I keep this charger at work and it gets the job done. It’s not as fast as my lighting one but still very good.
","
I needed another one of these to charge all of our devices, and this work as well if not better then the others I have! Super convenient so I can still use my earbuds
","
Looking to replace the inexpensive wireless charging pad with a much thinner, higher quality pad with a smaller foot print.  The Tozo W3 fit the bill perfectly.  As you can see in the photos, the foot print is significantly smaller and the thin profile is as about as minimal as one could expect.  I was impressed with the solid, quality feel of the aluminum pad of the top charging surface and was pleased to find that the charging cable port was USB-C (coming to Apple soon, maybe).  Charging performance on my iPhone 11Pro Max was excellent with my case on the phone.  The small foot print made it easy to hit the charging ""sweet spot"" every time, so no more ""missed"" charge due to sloppy placement.  One note, this charging pad does NOT come with a USB power brick, but that was not a big deal for me as I have several power bricks left over front other devices and was able to readily use one of them to power this pad.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.
","
Came packed very well and it works very good.
","
Works as intended.  It helps to keep my phone charged while at work.  I'm able to pick it up and go when I'm moving around the shop floor.

So convenient & charges quickly. Comes in fun colors too. (I got pink).

Loved that it worked. Didn’t like, phone must be positioned a certain way with in reason. A light is on all the time, which sucks if if you want total darkness to sleep in. If you’re phone gets bumped by you or your cat, it stops charging because that acceptable alignment is off.
","
Not much to say about this wireless charger, it takes USB type C which is good to see on modern electronics. The rating is a 4/5 as the cable length that they include in the box is a bit short for my needs. Although I do have a lot of USB type C cables so I just swapped it for a longer one that I had lying around. I will update this if it breaks but otherwise, it works for what it is intended to do.As a side note, the English that comes on the box is very bad. I think they meant to say that you should remove metal cases as it could interfere with the wireless charging. But it says something like remove metal from charger.
","
I bought this product to have a reliable charger when traveling. Something that would be small, easy to pack, but charge quickly. This charger satisfied all of those qualities. I appreciated the MagSafe compatibility as it allowed us to ensure that the phone is in place and charging securely. We found it charged the phones well. It worked so well that my wife kept stealing it to use for her phone. I may have to get another...

SO FAR SO GOOD, I HAVENT HAD IT THAT LONG.

4/5 because the charger does work but it just wasn't compatible with my Android phone which is the brand Alcatel.Overall it's a good size for traveling and a good charger. Charging seemed to work great when I put my sister's phone to the test.

This thing works great. I don't have to hunt for the sweet spot. I just set my phone down and it works. It lets me know that its changing and lets me know when its done, by changing the color of the lights. Super easy to see. Great when its really dark. Love this thing. Thanks Guys.
","
I bought this to charge my ear buds, but decided to try charging my phone and it works well. Some reviews say the lights are bright, I don't have that problem,  they are pretty dim in my opinion (lights bother me so it can't be that bad if it hasn't affected me). It's not a super fast charger, but I charge while I sleep so that isn't an issue for me. I really like the design and how easy it is to use. Just plug it in and forget it. I haven't had any issues and I have been using it for a few weeks now
","
This is an excellent wireless charger. It connects to my iPhone effortlessly. The USB C connection is advantageous as so many charging plugs are USB C.  the construction of the device is solid.
","
I bought this charger based on reviews, hopeful for a plate charger for my IphoneX. This charger is so slow!  I will put my phone on it for 30 min and get a 5% charge. If my phone is on and running an app it will charge it enough to keep the phone running but no more. If it was on 25% and playing a game it is on 20% when you take it off.  Very frustrated especially if you leave it on overnight.  I gave it 3 stars because it does have lights, so you know if the phone is actually charging or not.**Updated  customer service reached out to me and said this may be a defective model and is replacing it. I will update my review after I get the replacement.***Update- received the new charger it and is much faster. If you have a slow charger, contact them for a replacement!! Great customer service on top of their product.  Glad I gave them another chance

Not what I expected doesn’t charge my laptop
","
I got it for my dad for Father’s Day. He said it will charge his phone even through his wallet phone case. He said it does have to be plugged in to work (the picture suggests you can charge it up and go but apparently not). He also said his phone gets hot while charging on it. I have never used it myself so I can only go by what said has said but he seems happy with it. The only real set up is to plug it in (I did do that the first time). I bought it to charge the earbuds I got him which he didn’t know so maybe it’s more for those than your phone…?
","
It’s great so that I don’t have to fight with any cords to get my phone to change. But I would love it even better if it also charged my phone quick like it would through a lightning cable
","
I got this adapter to play with wireless charging for my Tozo T12  ear buds. It looks great and works well. I was pleased that it uses a modern USB C connector. I have several USB chargers that have USB c outputs and they, including the ones that support fast charging, work fine with the wireless charger as they should.  The USB 3 connector on my laptop also works fine with the supplied USB to USB C cable. However, older  USB chargers which I have don't work .The power spec for the adapter is 2 amps at 5 volts. which is the low power usb C standard. The T12 itself can be charged using the cable supplied with wireless charger and one of those adapters, but the wireless charger does not work using those adapters.  This isn't a big deal but it might be an issue for customers who don't already have usb C or usb 3 chargers.
","
This charge wasn't as fast as it should have been and the led light stays on all the time.  It can be a bother to some people..  I liked the small designed
","
Very easy to use. Looks great also.
","
I use this to charge my iPhone 11 Pro and my Tozo wireless earbuds. It’s easy to position the device to be charged on the pad, and it’s especially convenient to be able to pick up the phone or other device quickly from the pad instead of fussing to disconnect a cable, important if I get an urgent call at night. So far I’ve connected the charger to a USB port in my wall and another USB port on an iHome dock/radio unit. It has worked just fine with both. There’s enough power to do the job. Since the phone rests on the pad overnight, the extra time it takes to fully charge my phone is a non- issue. Wireless charging takes more time than using a lightning cable, so if time is of the essence, I use a cable. Aesthetically speaking, it matches my Tozo earbuds case, an added bonus😂  This seems to be a good value; just remember that wireless charging takes longer than cabled charging.

The light on the charger is ALWAYS on, even when the phone is not being charged, and it is very strong. The plan was to use the charger in the bedroom so I could charge the phone overnight, but it’s so bright it was just impossible to use, so I decided to return it. The charger looks great and feels good quality, but it makes no sense that the light is always on.
","
It charges well; the only complaint that I have is that it does not magnetize to the back of my phone so it’s annoying when I would like to use my phone while it’s charging
","
It come on time and works great
","
I don't know if it's luck of the draw or not, but I'm a week in and so far so good with my S9+. The first time I used it, I got a supercharge in 1 hour and 20 minutes from 15%. Ever since that first charge it now takes 3 hours instead. A slow charge would be 6-7 hours so I'm getting somewhere in between. For the price and the way I use my device I'm not even angry. I got the black version, and absolutely no issue with the charging lights being overly bright or bothering me while I'm sleeping. If it did though I found out quit quickly, and sit down now this is going to blow your mind. It's amazing if you just fine the sweet spot to charge, and then you rotate your device 90 degrees so the lights are covered up. It's like the problem just magically solves it's self! Though if you're charging headphones, point taken. If anything changes over the next year I'll report back.

When I first got this product I loved it. Beautiful color, slim design. After a few uses though it's all of a sudden not 100% compatible with my phone anymore. It'll still charge about as well as my Samsung one but now whenever I set it down a few seconds later I'll get a notification that fast charging isn't available. At first I thought maybe it was just off centered but no matter how I position it fast charging no longer works.Still charges and I still love how it looks so I'll keep using it. It's just a tad annoying at A) a feature that previously worked no longer does and B) it sends a notification that always gets me and has me thinking I have a text or something to check.

Buy the lightening cable or else it charges really slow, and the cord is too short.

This charger is pretty much dummy proof, it’s slick and classy. I have an Otterbox defender series on my iPhone 8 Plus and that’s where it won me over, this wireless charger manages to charge my phone without the need to remove my case. The only downside to this product is that it lacks the wall socket charger but that’s no biggie since I used my original charger which I assume saves me a few $$$ for having to pay for something I already have. I was so impressed with this charger that I ordered 3 more for all my family to include my 5 year old. The lights on the top plate of the wireless charger are very easy to read for my toddler and even she knows now if the phone is placed correctly and charging or if it needs adjustment. Another big plus is the safety of my daughter not having to need to handle any wires to charge or disconnect our phones for her when she decides to jack up our data all day in the road (not that I let her plug in my phone but having to stop to attend my 5 year old is a demanding job especially if the phones dying). Thank you for the very well crafted charger.
","
A bit smaller than I expected but I love it regardless. Quality weight to it and fast charges my note 9  ,only wish the usb c cable was a bit longer
","
Will not charge a Samsung S20 in fast charge mode, no matter what power supply or cord I use. Even took the phone out of the case and still no fast charge. Other bases I have charge it fast through the case. Disappointing.
","
So I purchased this specifically because it said it had fast charged capabilities.  I charge my phone 3 ways to conduct the test I plugged in to a general outlet and it said it would take about an hour and 26 minutes to complete stick complete charge to a 100%.  I then used the wireless charging and it came out the same number when using it with a general outlet.  I then use my phone to the charger that it came with yes and it said it would be 40 minutes to completion at a 100%.  I then used this wireless charger with that same chord that I got the fast charge with and it said it would complete the charge in an hour.  So just as noted with the at the title of this review it's a faster charge but it is not the fast charge you expect.  I'm not sure how I feel right now about keeping it I'm getting a new phone tomorrow and want to see if it's different I did these tests with a Samsung S20 5G.
","
My husband takes it to charge while on Bluetooth calls. He apologized for taking it to the office. We will purchase another for his bedside table.
","
good Product but little bit slow charging
","
Seems very finicky to phone placement. You have to find the sweet spot. Sometimes very frustrating

 This mag safe charger is the real deal. At 20W output, it’s more powerful than Belkin or anker chargers, at a fraction of the price. The magnetic lock is strong (see video) and the fact that it comes with a charging block is just a bonus. Def recommend!
","
Fulfilled expectations
","
The wireless charger came in a nice package and arrived on time.  Easy to install , the box comes with a cord but you will need to use your own adaptor.It charges an iPhone 11 faster than the original charger it came with, which I’m extremely happy for.The only two downsides :1. I received a damaged/broken charger. The charger has 2 lights which will indicate if the phone is charging but mine only had one side turn on. The charger still works but it would of been nice to have both work.—— I did get in contact with the seller and they quickly responded and fixed the issue. So I’ll definitely give 5 stars on that. ——2.  It didn’t charge my EarPods. You have to pay attention to the generation. Since I have a first generation it didn’t charge but I believe if you have newer or more recent EarPods this shouldn’t be a problem.
","
I 3D printed a phone holder for my truck.  I incorporated this to make it a wireless charger.  it works perfectly.  It's a shame that it can't be seen in my application. It is a very nice design and It has a high-quality feel to it.  Solid and heavy.  The 2.5 mm thickness is at the edge.  The center is a little thicker but it is still pretty thin overall.  Very pleased with this charger.
","
Only used it once so far, so can't comment on durability, but it worked as advertised once.  Connection and charge times were excellent.  The thin height was important and was as good as could be expected.
","
Apparently for Moto Z phones there is NO fast charging.  I did buy the wireless charging receiver for Moto Z phones, but that does NOT work unless you ALSO have the correct Moto extra battery mod.  I have a TUMI battery mod and when I put that battery mod on the phone AND added the wireless charging receiver, this pad did begin charging, but NOT fast.  No faster than my phone would charge when hooked up to the cord I have for it.  So okay, it charges, but it doesn't charge fast for my Moto Z phone...
","
Aesthetically, I love how this charger looks. Minimalist, glassy. The light is easy to see at night so I’m not looking for it. Lightweight, uses usb type c, and I have tons of type c chargers I can’t apply to my iPhone. Very convenient. It charges my phone fast and for the price, this charger is superior.
","
Wanted to give this 5 stars, but it's really 4.5 in my opinion. Aesthetically, it's super-nice - has a great look and feels good in the hand. I've bought four for the house and it's super convenient to have these around in different places. The minus half a star is for the fact that it takes a lot longer to charge with this device than just plugging in my phone to a charger (Samsung S9). Seems like around twice the time. Not a big deal for an overnight charge, or even for most charging scenarios, but sometimes you really need to get that phone charged up quick, and for that, you still need a cord. Still, nice product.
","
It didn't set fire to my house and it works great! I would give it 5 stars if my phone didn't scratch the plastic
","
This thing is very nice working and it works well.  I particularly like the fact that the LED indicators are always on and indicating the state of the connection.  It makes it obvious when you have it positioned badly and are not charging.  Other ones I have do not indicate misalignment so well - Sometimes I only find out about bad placement when it is uncharged in the morning.
","
I bought this charger for my wife and I selected pink. Problem is it was pink on the bottom, not the top. It works fine.

 I honestly thought it would be a little bigger than what it actually is but it works good. Won’t charge if you have a thick case though
","
I don’t really know what to say. It’s a wireless charger for the iPhone. Works exactly like the OEM but for a fraction of the price. Strong magnet and fast charging.
","
Simple,  takes up little room, quick enough for charging
","
I just got this today and it works great.  I also own the Tozo W1 model and the W6 is so much smaller/compact.  The W6 also came with a little velcro cable holster which is a nice touch.  I have an iPhone 11 and the magnet seems to attach to my phone but the strength of the magnet paired with this model doesn't work very well, I'm sure it's plenty strong for the iPhone 12.  The only thing I wish it had was some sort of lighting like the W1 as it's nice to get the visual cue from the charger itself that it's juicing up your battery or that your battery is fully charged without having to glance at the device that is on the charger. Something around the outside edge would be nice seeing as how small it is, my phone completely eclipses the charger itself.  All in all it serves it's purpose and seems to be working well.
","
I charge my AirPods with it and really like the way it looks.
","
I've recently jumped into the world of wireless charging after trying one out and seeing how convenient it really is.  So, I went looking around and found this one on a lightning deal with lots of great reviews.When I received it, I excited to set it up and had the perfect spot picked out for it.  When I pulled it out of the box I really liked the smoothness and shininess of it.  It looks really nice and isn't just a matte plastic top.  The indicator lights are small and simple and located just a little inside of the edge, which makes it great for using in your bedroom to charge while you sleep because the light isn't leaking out of the edges nor is it bright enough to light up the part of the room where it is sitting.  The lights are really easy to see when looking at it.  The other thing that I was surprised at was that it is USB C (I didn't read the details too closely when I purchased it).  If you ever travel with this you can just use the same cable in the car then bring it into wherever your staying to charge at night, or use the cable you already have (if your phone uses USB C) and connect it to this and not have to move anything around.
","
Ok, I was pretty skeptical that I'd get a decent charger for how inexpensive this is, but I own a pair of Tozo headphones so I figured I'd give these a shot. Bought 3 of them and they worked great, at first. A little after a month of owning them, one of them died. Lights won't come on when I plug it in and it doesn't charge anything. I contacted customer support and they said they'll send me a new one and that I don't need to worry about sending the old one back in. Great customer service, and the other two chargers work great, so I assume the third one was just a fluke.
","
Tried the stand type chargers for my iPhone 13 ProMax and none worked as they all seem to be too short not allowing the charging coils to align with the ones in the larger/taller ProMax’s.  Tried this Tozo W1 and it works great. The 13 ProMax is big enough to cover the charging led’s so I haven’t noticed any excessive bright lights at night like some reviews have mentioned. Charger just works like it should and has no problem charging through an iPhone 13 ProMax Otterbox Defender Pro case like some chargers have issues with.
","
I’ve been using this for a couple of months now so I’m reviewing some usage rather than just how it looks coming out of the box.The charging pad is super thin and unimposing.  It has rubber feet that keep it firmly in one place so it won’t slide around with movement of the cable.  The status LED is on one edge so you can see the status when your phone is charging.  The previous model had the LED on the top which of course gets covered.I’ve been charging both wireless earbuds and an iPhone.  Both seem to charge efficiently and I haven’t noticed any issues with speed of charging, not that I’m generally in any great hurry.  In any case slower charging is better for the battery than super fast charging.I would recommend this product based on my experience with it.

Small and effective

 This charger I plugged into my USB meter for testing.  I got 0.64A and 8.96V while using Macbook Pro USB-C charger, which converts to about 5.73 watts as is what is expected for charging an iPhone 11.  If this were an iPhone 12, I’d expect a lot higher, but I didn’t have one handy for the test.  This is enough to run my maps software, play some music and drive.  I tested quite a few bumps, and the mount held steady.  It is magnetic and works with my iPhone 11 magsafe case.  The back of the charger is also able to stick to my legacy magnetic phone mount, which upgraded it to MagSafe!  I didn’t need any other mount, which is a major plus!  Two birds with one stone.  This will work with a decent MagSafe case, so find yourself a case that works with your phone, and your golden!
","
It’s not the fastest charger but it does work. I would buy it again especially for how convenient and sleek looking it is.
","
Easy set up. Just plug in and lie the phone down and it charges
","
Pros- It's cute, it's cheap, and it's hands-free charging. I have tozo headphones and I love that it can charge those too.Cons- The charge doesn't last as long as it does when I use the actual cord.It doesn't travel that well cause it's a plate. Perhaps in the future, the seller could add a bag.Like I said it's not bad, but I do feel like for some extra cash you could get a better one that does the job better. If you are just looking for something inexpensive and cute then this will do.Best to all.
","
This item looks really nice and is super thin which would make it great for traveling or in a laptop bag. Unfortunately, that is where the good comments end. My biggest complaint is that this unit come with a very short cable and I have been unable to get it to work properly with ANY other USB C cable that I have. (I have tried multiple different cables of varying lengths and qualities) So, it seems that it will only work with the cable it comes with which is about 30"" long. The second complaint I have is that although it will charge my phone (very slowly, no fast charge) it will not recognize either of my earbud cases on the charger which are both Qi complaint and have no problems on my other wireless charger. So, in the end it is a pretty little unit and has a nice feel to it, but it's just not all that functional (at least for me) and I would not recommend it. I ended up putting it back in the box and tossing it in a drawer.

Update 8/19/20The customer service team reached out to me and offered to send me another device which I received a few weeks ago. This one charges fine with no problems.The customer service has been extremely kind and helpful through this whole process. I wanted to wait to write an update to make sure it worked.———It worked for 1 day. The first day I tried it, it charged my iPhone 10 fine. Today, I put my phone on it, it turned blue to signal it was charging. I left it on for about 2 hours and the charging percent never changed, it stayed at 65%. Yesterday it charged within 2 hours. I’m not sure why it didn’t charge today, even though it signaled it was charging. My phone even showed the charging symbol when I checked, however the charge never progressed passed 65%.
","
Son buenos para viajes pero muy lentos al cargar
","
The one I received didn't have the lights on the top like advertised which is one of the reasons I went with this brand. When the phone is on it u can't see it anyways so not a huge deal but would have been easier to find in the dark if it had the lights like advertised. Instead it just came with a very small led on the side that's not that bright. Does look really nice though and charges my s21 ultra with a thick case but a message does pop up saying the charger isn't good enough to fast charge but I bought it for my night stand to charge the phone overnight so not a deal breaker.
","
It does what it’s supposed to do. It just takes a really really long time. Looking to get a faster adapter to see if the charging speeds up
","
So far so good. I love how the green light turns to blue to let me know it is charging. My last charger had no light. I hope this one lasts!
","
I am so impressed by this TOZO WIRELESS CHARGER!!  So slim that you could carry it in a pocket if you wanted to. I can see how easy it would be to travel with this Charger. It is as fast and efficient as TOZO says and does a great job of making the charging of my TOZO Ear Buds very easy and quick. Not only is it not expensive, but TOZO also gives you a Free 1 year Extended Warranty as well. (Also provided for the TOZO Ear Buds upon purchase) This Charger does everything that TOZO claims it will. Definitely, the perfect Charger for many different Devices. I recommend that you try this product!*After being in contact with TOZO, I HAVE to add to this review and let you know how efficient and caring their Customer Service is. Even though we are oceans apart, Sophia at TOZO has been so quick to respond to my questions. Honestly, I feel that many USA companies could learn from TOZO. They actually care about what the customer thinks of their products. I am pleasantly surprised and more than pleased to find this out. I am definitely a loyal customer after using their top of the line products and services. There is not many companies in the world today that care like Tozo does. If you want the best, you will get it in every way, everytime with TOZO. I'm a happy customer!
","
Can’t believe I bought this, takes hours to charge your phone. It’s finicky and have to find the sweet spot to make it charge. Sometimes just stops charging randomly
","
I bought it because of these reasons, in the order of importance to me:1) lightweight and thin; It is literally about 5mm thin, if you don’t include the rubber ‘footing,’ which I peeled off and I intend on using Sugru to put my own thinner and more stable footing.  It is so lightweight that it feels almost plasticky.2) price; for under $20, plus a discount, you can’t beat that!  That’s cheaper than an Apple Lightning cable!  It charges my iPhone and AirPod; what else do I need in a charger?  I don’t need it to be super fast because I usually charge things overnight.  Besides, quick charge adapters are extra cost, so they’re not worth it to me.Some people might not like the lights being on all the time.  To me it doesn’t matter because the charger is not in my bedroom and the lights don’t bother me.  After a few days of use, I see that it does not heat up either.I like the mirror finish and the Apple-like white and aluminum look.The packaging is nice, a seal of authentication and online product registration link.  The company seems to be very good about customer service.More wireless chargers out there should look like and cost like this one!
","
I have a Galaxy S9 and my husband has a Galaxy 8. The charger was simple and easy to use - placed the phone on the charger and it started charging. It even charged through my Otterbox Commuter case. I did end up removing my case because I have a metal finger hold on the back and charging my phone through this made the metal VERY hot. The charger itself and the phone itself doesn't get hot. Removed the cover with the metal piece and no problem. Also, fast charging! Two hours for a full charge from less than 5%. I would recommend this product.I bought 2 of these the black and the rose gold. The rose gold was definitely pink, not rose gold but it still really chic looking.Just a reminder - you need the wall plug or block for the USB. I knew this and it is explicitly stated but just wanted to reiterate!
","
Well, I ordered silver, the box was marked ""silver"", but it was white. I let it go - it works for a quick boost of my charge when I'm sitting at my desk. Not sure it's doing the high-speed charging, even though the phone is capable of it.
","
This charger is so awesome home it is magnetic. to my iPhone 14. I love the wireless charging. This is like a mag safe charger. Great design! Thank you TOZO! So far so good as far as functionality. No issues.
","
These are great!!  Bought them to have a set in the trailer - both my husband and I like these so much better than the ones that came with our phones.  They are less ""picky"" about how the phone lines up to activate charging, they charge faster, they're more compact; the soft light doesn't interfere with sleeping, and does let you know they're working - we love them.
","
It’s great to be able to drop my phone on the charger. I’m on call slot and often it’s just to answer questions and go back to sleep. This is a simple solution for me to keep my phone charging and not fight cords as I fumble through my sleep.
","
As the title states this is my first ever wireless charger (mostly due to having an old phone for a very long time and only now upgrading to something that can use this). I got a used iPhone X in like new condition and this charger works great with it. Also works eve with my Pelican case AND single layer of microfiber cloth (I do this to hide it mostly).Oh and a tip... if you dislike scratches like me keep the plastic that comes on the top. You can even peel the tab off if you are careful (it is not easy but can be done with only slight bubbles left over from pulling the material and possibly some goo-gone needing to be used one some left over glue but mine came out well enough in the end).As for longevity it is far too early to tell but the 1-year warranty sounds nice so hopefully no worries there.
","
I thought I would love this thing. I have used them in hotel rooms and thought it would be a good useful product. The issue: the phone has to be perfectly situated on the disc or it won’t charge. You have to be very cognisant of that or you’ll go to retrieve your phone and it won’t have a charge.
","
I have an iPhone 8 and was looking for a smaller wireless charger for my phone. My iPhone can’t use the magnetic capabilities of this charger, but I like that it charges faster than my previous Tozo wireless charger. I also like that there are no lights on this charger so I can use it on my bedside table without it being a distraction at night. It is only about 2” in diameter which is good for a smaller bed side table.  My iPhone does feel warm after being on the charger. It comes with a USB to USB C adapter so you can use it with either type of power plug in. I also use it to charge my earbud case wirelessly. I plan to upgrade to the iPhone 12 at some point and this charger is about half the cost of the Apple MagSafe.

 I have 4 cats and they sometimes like to make a mess of things. This charger has been bit, scratched, and knocked around like crazy but it still works great and theres no scratches. Its a bit bright when trying to sleep but i just have my phone cover the lights and its fineEdit: i put a few layers (3 to be exact) of washi tape over the lights and it fixed the problem.

I really like the ease of use and aesthetic stylings of this unit. Charges my phone VERY quickly.  Highly recommended!

Wanted to like this but gave up and returned it. Major issues: 1)There is no light on the surface as indicated on the box/product description, only a very small poorly positioned and weak led light on the pad thickness; 2) Have to position the cellphone very carefully for it to charge. Quarter of an inch off and it will not charge and you will only not notice until next day when you see the cellphone with low battery. 3) It occasionally makes a very high frequency noise that can be annoying to some.

My old one didn’t work with the otter box case. This one works great. Small green light on the side turns blue to indicate charging engaged.

I went to an Airbnb that had one of these and I loved it so much I ordered one for myself whilst we were still on vacation.  Then I ordered another one.  One for home and one for work.  Love love love, wish I could give them 10 stars!

Will charge through 1/8-inch of wood + most phone cases! I make oak tables and use the TOZO chargers for their greater distance between charger and devices. So far, no complaints. One customer did question why I was hiding a ""High-End"" charger within the wood...""The one with the best charging range.""
","
Appearance acceptable,  typically poor Chinese instructions regarding  light scheme expections?
","
Fits nicely on my desk. Charges my phone fast
","
I like that it's thin and looks very nice. I'm still getting used to the size though. It's just under 4 inches in diameter. Positive side?...portable! Its glass surface means that with my S9+ in a case and with a pop socket, it's a juggle to not have it slide off or lose contact. This is to say that it charges smaller items with no connection issues. It charges slowly right now, but that's probably because I have not connected it to a QC 3.0 adapter (just a reminder that this charger comes with a cable but no adapter). I'm hoping it can charge faster when I plug it to a fast charge adapter. To be determined!
","
Super easy to use and way more convenient to charge one’s phone and tws earbuds with. If you use the correct charging adapter and charging cable as the instructions illustrate, you will get a much faster charge than with the cable that comes with your device when you purchased it. It does charge my wife’s phone, even with the otter box still on it. For the price, it’s so worth it and so convenient. You will need to spend a little extra to get the micro usb “C” cable and the 5v adapter to get your quick charge. I got a good deal on the 6ft Ainope USB cable and would recommend it personally. I’m suppose to register this within 14 days of purchasing it, but when I purchased it, it was in advance for a gift, so I hope they honor the warranty🤞. After all, one has to do a review to even get this 1 yr warranty...clever thinking on their part, I just hope they honor it. But it’s cheap enough that if it were to break I could easily afford another one. Also, the design is very sleek and classy looking on my mesita next to my living room couch.
","
The charging port on my iPhone quit working so now I use the TOZO to charge my iPhone. It is reliable, easy to use, and is very small.
","
I have a Galaxy Note 10 and recently get the dreaded moisture detected in your charger, in spite of never actually never having my charger or my phone near water. So I could no longer charge my phone via the USB C port. Fortunately, the phone can be charged wirelessly. Which lead to me purchasing this charger, which works great for the price. Most importantly it saved me from having to buy a new phone, which would have really sucked.
","
Nothing to dislike. Works well and worth the price.
","
For the amazing price it seems to be good. The metal housing and slim shiny lacquered face are very nice. Very classy and you wouldn't even know it was a charge except it has a cord coming out of it. Seems to charge well. I don't ever need ""fast"" charging as it probably isn't good for batteries anyways. It seemed to work with a very thick case from Newdery that others mentioned has issues with wireless chargers from other companies. Positioning is easy and the lights make it super simple to know if you placed it correctly. I have tried with an iPhone 12pro and it seems to work as well I have not tried with a high speed charger yet so I can't tell you how that will work. I assume it would work fine but who knows. My thinking is wireless is slow and anything that I don't have to plug in is a luxury.

Easy portable wireless charger fits in your pocket for on the go charging

Thought this was going to work on my Fire tablet and Motorola phone, but did not work on either. :{

So, this product is amazing, it's very thin and great build quality for the price the only issue I have, for my Samsung Z fold 3 anyways, is that it doesn't support fast charging and yes, my wall adapter can support up to 30 Watts and the cable I use with it can support up to 100 Watts, so I know it's not those things. Other than that, a great product

It looks nice but my other one you can see the light better on my other one from the side. This one you also need to position it well. The other you don’t. But this one looks nice.

Its definitely a gorgeous premium looking wireless charger. Surprised to see that the its very thin and have only 4.7mm that is the same height of a usb c port.Pros:- Gorgeous design and aesthetics- Very thin, light and portable- Fast wireless charging (7.5 W for iPhone series and 10W for Samsung series) with Usb C port- Very small charging indicator, so its not that distracting at night- Can charge phone with its case on (Its charged my Note 10 with Samsung rugged case on it)- 1 year warranty for peace of mindCons:- Yes, this one as well not came with the power brick like the Apple 12 series phones :Conclusion:A beautiful, premium looking, practical and portable fast wireless charger. As it is very portable, it would have been great to have a cloth cover as its very glossy and prone to scratches. It comes with 1 year warranty for the peace of mind.

I have the sweetest, but hairiest, little kitty.  I figured that the only way I could hope to control his hair issue is to have a robot vacuum that would clean underneath every couch, table, etc., every night.  (I LOVE that this little vacuum will clean and dust so much more floor that I would with an traditional vacuum!  The dust and cat-hair reservoirs in my home have been emptied!)  One of my favorite things is to push the Power button before going to sleep and wake up to a beautiful floor every day.When I set up the vacuum, I passed on uploading the app.  Other owners had said that the app was intrusive and requires too much personal information.  As another reviewer suggested, rather than controlling my vacuum via an app, I simply press the power button when I want it to clean and then it does an outstanding job.  The app is not required to achieve robot bliss.
","
It is great but my only issue with it is that you can not turn off the LED ring. I wish it would stay green unless in use, that would be the ticket. but hell for the price. Worth it. Looks fantastic. Works great with my phone and my airpod pros.
","
I liked this charger but it will disconnect for no reason. It’s annoying to wake up and see my phone didn’t charge. The charging blinking light is a little bright for my tastes but that’s my problem, not a fault of the charger. It’s fine if you can keep your eye on it and can adjust it when it disconnects.

I got got. I should've read the reviews but this was a Lightning deal and had to make the purchase or not. I was shocked, a wireless charger! WOW! It's a simple wireless charging platform but still needs to be connected to the wall/USB. I was looking and hoping for a clean look with just the pad as the headline and many photos say/show/suggest. Anyhow, for $12, it's whatever since it does work and looks nice (if you don't mind the cord) but now you know.  To the seller, perhaps reword the title. Cheers,

I have owned this charger over 6 months. It does not always charge. I have put my phone on the charger almost every night since it arrived, and over 16 times it has stopped charging the phone sometime in the night. I have woken to a dead, uncharged phone, which is unacceptable... the charger has literally ONE job, to CHARGE the phone. The charger is not placed where it can be bumped by me or my pets. I have continued to use this charger for so long to make sure it was not a fluke... it keeps happening.The charging area is tiny compared to better models, so a slight shift of the phone on the pad and it won't charge. Initially thought that may be why phone stopped charging sometimes, but no. I have diligently put the charger where it cannot be bumped, and checked the blue light in the day, and the charger sometimes just stops charging when the battery is not charged.The blue/green charger lights never go off. They are both pretty bright and would be too much light to have on a night stand.This charger may look and feel decent, but if it doesn't always charge, that's a 1 star charger. Another reviewer how had similar problems gave it 4 stars... but I don't want to have to babysit a phone charger. This may be fine for a desk, a daytime charger. If you don't ming checking on it every hour or so. 😕

Wireless charger, nothing super fancy. Neat magnet system. Charges thru my case which is a bonus. Love it
","
I admit, I bought this for the looks, but should have read the reviews further.  You have to really perfectly align your phone to a particular orientation or else it will not charge.  My other wireless charger is more foregiving, where I can literally just throw my phone and it will charge.  For this one, you need to spend the extra several seconds in perfectly matching to see the lights go ""blue"".  Super annoying especially when you don't have time to spend on such a trivial thing during the day.  Also, the charge time seems excessively slow compared to other wireless chargers.  I've kept the item, but would not buy again nor recommend to others.

Me encanta este producto, todo es de 5 estrellas exceptuando que CARGA ÚNICAMENTE SI ESTÁ ENCHUFADO. Me hubiera gustado que para viajes fuese un puerto de carga que funcionara con una batería inalámbrica
","
It doesn’t connect to my phone every time. Need to keep repositioning my phone until it senses it.
","
It works quite well.Charges my iPhone 13 mini better than my prior inductive charger.  Phone is less warm at the end than when charged using my prior inductive charger.  Seems to accept phone at any rotation on the circular plate (again, better than my prior charger.)The indicator LED is too bright for a dark room, such as a bedroom.I ordered the black model but received a white one.  (The marking on the box was for for yet another color.)Came with a USB-C/USB-A cable.
","
Very flat and easy to use. Wish there something similar for AirPods.
","
It’s easy, convenient, but very slow at charging. My iPhone charges 100% when directly connected to a cord in a less than a quarter of the time that this wireless charger takes.I would not recommend.
","
The charger worked as expected, just don't expect it to stay scratch free ive had mine two weeks and it's got quite a few minor scratches on it.
","
By far best wireless charger I’ve tried for iPhone. The other two I bought were both “brand“ name ones from Apple, and both were double the price of this one; but neither worked as well!!My gripe with the other two were they were so hard to match up to the phone, you had to place the phone on just the right spot to get it to charge.This one basically charges whichever way I place the phone. Also, the genius indicator light turns blue and can either be visible when charging, or completely covered by the phone for those who like to sleep in total darkness (like me), depending the way face the phone. When not charging, the Green light also doubles as a landing strip for those that charge their phone in the dark right before going to bed, which I assume is everyone.Only wish the y usb cord was longer, but guess I can just buy one.So happy with this purchase
","
First time bought Tozo product and was impressed. I needed MagSafe charger for travel/office use. For the price this is excellent quality charger. It looks well built but has a short cable. Including usb A adapter was a great idea.
","
a gift for my grandsons and husband  they all really like them  they work quickly and well
","
It won't fast charge my Galaxy S21, but after some thought it shouldn't matter. In order to fast charge, the USB cable feeding it needs to be powered by an Adaptive Fast Charger. So on the few occasions I really need a fast charge, I can just plug the cable directly into the phone. And I don't want to fast charge except when necessary. So I'm keeping it.What I like about it is the amazing non-skid on both the top and the bottom of the pad. It's almost impossible for an accidental knock to dislodge the phone.
","
Product works properly, but there are a few key differences between this an the official Magsafe charger from Apple.Size - This product has a 60mm diameter versus the 55mm that Apple uses. So if you are using an vent mount or stand (3d printed or bought) you need to make sure it'll fit a 60mm one. It's also thicker, can't remember off-hand how much, but you can see in the pics. I designed a 3D printed holder for this one and it'll be posted to Thingiverse shortly.Magnet Strength - The magnet strength on the Official Apple Magsafe charger is stronger than this one. This one is pretty strong though, especially for desk applications.Charging Speed - Seems to be just as fast as the official MagSafe charger.Price - Less than half of the official apple charger. I'll gladly buy a few of these for the price of the official!
","
This is perfect for traveling however charging my phone was not so way it would stop charging and I would have to re-adjust the position of my phone then it would charge. It did the job but was a little inconvenient having to do this a few times.
","
Great charger! I have purchased it as extra for office, it works great, charges fast and is stylish looking.
","
Overall it's great.  The problem that I have is that it won't charge through an otterbox.
","
Plugged it in and it works with my iPhone.
","
I have 2 Samsung 20 FE 5g phones. Works well.  We use a magnetic phone holder wile driving.  Once I realized that if the metal plate attached to the phone would act like an induction heater and make to phone heat up, I moved the metal plates and now the charger charges very well including Quick Wireless charging.
","
I loved having this charger sitting on my desk at work. I like to play music during the day so it’s nice to just sit it down and it’s charging. My husband uses his at night on his nightstand and they charge pretty quickly! I did have an issue where they stopped working but customer service responded quickly and assured me they’d get it take care of for me. I really appreciate that because they are super handy chargers to have. Especially for the 12 pro and 12 pro Max like we have. I only gave four stars just because they stopped working but they’re going to fix that issue for us. All in all, great purchase!
","
This isn't a bsd item.  It's very large so if you have limited desk or bedside space it's difficult to ace. If you are going to use it bedside be aware it has a very bright LED light. Too bright for me. It is not magnetic for the newer Apple phones. It's very thing which is nice. The cord that came with it is short..USB to type C.  I would like it better if it weren't for the LED lights.
","
No issues whatsoever. It's small, discreet but also quick to charge. I have chargers plugged in all over the place in my room, so I can take the wireless charger and connect it near my PC when I'm working, or have it near my bed and have my phone charge as I'm sleeping. I have to have my phone nearby when I sleep so that when my alarm goes off I can grab my phone and throw it across the room.All in all it's a pretty useful device, and it looks nice too.
","
Sad trombone.
","
Wireless charging is awesome and this charger works well.It does not include the power adapter, but one you have at home already might work.Check the charger's wattage.A 2W USB charger will NOT work.From there, charging speed varies depending on your device and charger's wattage.My 5W charger (pic attached) came with a Motorola device but charges and iPhone SE just fine.It's possible I'd get faster charging with another adapter, but I use this overnight so it doesn't really matter.The charger I received had a slightly loose USB connection but I emailed TOZO and a replacement is on the way.I'm very pleased with the product overall and will update my review once the replacement charger arrives.
","
This lil thing works like a dream! It's so incredibly sleek and absolutely fits with the cyber asthetic I have for my desk! It's so easy to use too! It's USB operated so you need a wall plug but if you are going to plug it into a USB port you are good to go! Love this charger!

Great charger.  I have a galaxy 22s ultra with a thick case on it and it charges without issue.

 I do very much like this wireless charger. The charges both of my Samsung Galaxy S9s on a fast wireless charge. I also had bought their wireless headphones a while ago because they are of really good quality and I saw somewhere in the reviews that you can recharge your headphones on this wireless charger. To my great surprise and pleasure, you most definitely can. It is very thin, and I like the lights on at that indicate when your device is finished charging. I would recommend this to anybody who wants a budget but very stand up piece of equipment to wirelessly charge your phone and some other devices that use the same protocol, it especially helps me and one of my phones because the charger port isn't what it used to be. (Excuse my banged up screen protector in my video lol)
","
Works great, but if you’re planning to use this on your nightstand at night, be advised that the neon colors it displays are quite bright. I usually end up putting a shirt over it and my phone.
","
I love the physical aesthetic of this product. It is thin, USD-C, good power, and nice looking. However, the big issue with this product outshines all potential benefits... Literally. The LED status indicator is absolutely insane. The thing is crazy bright and shines constantly. It is so annoying. The moment my wife walked into our room, after I set two of these up, she just laughed and said there was no way they were staying in there.I considered breaking the LEDs, but figured Id rather just return them.The other downside is the smooth top, it is so sleek that any phone without a rubberized phone case just slides right off (even some that do have cases). It is part of the aesthetic but an unclear trade off.
","
Super slim design and feels like good quality. My charger didn’t have the led lights on the top part of the pad, just a small led bulb on the front that is green when plugged in, and turns blue when charging. The bulb actually casts a pretty bright light in the bedroom at night, could be bothersome when sleeping. No issues with accurately placing the phone and having it not charge... I throw down my iPhone 10S and it always charges. I never need to adjust the phone on the pad. This item doesn’t come with a power block, only the pad and a usb cable. I have a tech21 slim plastic phone case and it charges with no issues.
","
I took off one star just because does not come with cable, otherwise, very good unit. Writing this review after 6 month of everyday use. No problems so far
","
Bought this for a friend of mine to use.Pros: came highly rated, affordable, sleek and simple to use and set upCons: Short power cable, charges slower than plugging the phone in directly
","
I took it out of my backpack and plugged it in and it charged my phone pretty quick
","
The product looks nice when you get it but unfortunately it would work on or off ... i would wake up in the morning and my phone didn’t charge and sometimes it did. The charger would just turn off during the night despite it still being plugged into the outlet. Everything else that was plugged in worked so I know it was the charger. I had to return it within the first week I got it....Updated 9/12/18Originally I gave the product 2 stars. The company reached out and sent me a replacement so I could try it one more time. Glad to say that the charger is working great. It doesn't turn off, charges my phone pretty fast as well. The only thing is that you have to make sure you place your phone on the charger correctly (the light will turn blue when its charging which is so convenient). I really appreciate the company going out of their way and correct the first error. I'm sure it was just bad luck the first time.
","
I have an iPhone 11 max pro in a Otter heavy duty wallet type  case. With the magnetic cover that stays on 100% of the time. Of course you take it out of the wallet and place the phone on the charger in the magnetic case and it works perfectly 99% of the time. I had a different charger/brand similar to this one prior that hardly EVER worked without fussing with it. This one works really really well compared to that one.  This one charges fast. Doesn’t over charge. Has a blue/green light that lets you know if it’s still charging or not.  I’m totally satisfied with this purchase.
","
Ours has a very small sweet spot to actually charge. We usually have to fine tune it to get it charging. And whoa unto you who charges overnight without double checking.
","
I got this charger for its sleek look and hoped it wouldn't bother me in a dark bedroom. It certainly doesn't disappoint. It's made very well and has a bit of heft to it despite its thin build. Rubber pads keep it from sliding. It takes a micro USB which is included in the box. I was disappointed to discover that the silver color refers to just the thin rim around the edge of the unit. From the picture I thought the whole pad would be silver, but it is just white, which still looks fantastic. The light is green when on and blue when a device is placed on it. Without a phone or device covering the led indicators, it may be a bit bright for sensitive sleepers, but after my phone is placed, only a soft glow, virtually nonexistent, surrounds the base. The bases diameter is wide enough that I don't have to worry about my phone sliding off; a welcome feature versus my last charging pad.
","
The problem with most wireless chargers on the market is that they're too bulky and ugly looking. Keep in mind this thing will have to take up precious desk space where you look at everyday. This is the only SLEEK wireless charger I could find and elegant looking to say the least. If it's possible to get them THIS razor thin and have it looking this good, there's no excuse for the others to be so bulky. Aside from its beautiful aesthetics, this charger works exactly as intended. I have a case on my phone and the charge still goes through, and the LED indicators change from green to blue when charging. Works exactly as intended, and on top of all that its extremely affordable. Just pick this one, you can't go wrong.
","
I love the look of this wireless charger, it looks really sleek. It can charge my phone even with a case and a pop socket on. However, I have a couple issues with it and will not use it as my everyday, overnight charger.First, the sound of it is annoying. The ""fast-charging"" capabilities make it emit a high frequency buzzing noise and is not good for sleeping right next to. If it is across the room from where you sleep it will probably be fine.The second issue I have is the lights on it. It lights up green when your phone is not on the charger, and it lights up blue when it is charging. It is a pretty bright light, and it could honestly be used as a night light lol. Anyways, the bigger issue is that it STAYS lit up green whenever you have it plugged in. It's just a waste of electricity honestly... I unplug it every day to save electricity, which is inconvenient if you just want to plug it in and forget about it. I'll be purchasing a wireless charger that doesn't have lights, but I don't think I can get away from the buzzing noise of fast-chargers.
","
My LG's charging port stopped working, while I figure out what to do next, this saved the day! Even charges with my case on! Sleek and simple, this is my first wireless charger and I am happy with the purchase.
","
But the Apple users in my class love it!
","
Great for traveling. Charging is okay, could be a little faster.
","
This was very easy to use.  I bought this to go with the wireless earbuds I got for my son but wanted to also be able to use this with his iPhone XR.  It took me a little to figure out what they meant by what was needed to make this work with an iPhone but I bought a Quick Charge 3.0 adapter.  It comes with the USB to USB C cord. I plugged the cord into the Quick Charge port on the adapter I bought and the headphones instantly started charging.  I put my iPhone XR on it face up and it started charging quickly even though I have a case and pop socket on it.  I have limited experience with wireless chargers - I just own one that is terrible so I didn’t have high expectations, but for this price I took a chance and I’m impressed!
","
Falls off the ear when I bend down , is the only flaw I see.  Works great. Has good surround sound
","
This charger works great.  The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because if the phone isn't sitting on it in the right spot, the phone wont charge - as in, if the phone is just sitting on the charger, it may not be charging.  This could just have something to do with my particular phone (Samsung S21).  However, there are green LED lights that change to blue when it is charging, so you do get a visual if it's charging or not.  I would still recommend this charger, just be aware of the position the phone is when placing it on the charger.
","
Charges everything that has pad charging abilitiesMy iPhone and airpodsVery sleek looking product. Small & compactEasy to travel withDoesnt charge that fast but its not meant to be a fast chargerI would recommend buying multiple of these to have around the house
","
A quality product that I purchased because it was economically priced. I was surprised of the quality. This charger was perfect for my iphone.
","
Fast charging, good, thin, shiny surface as promised
","
I love that I can lay my phone by my bed, charger on the nightstand, and when I wake up my phone is fully charged and ready to go. If I have any late night calls or texts, I don’t have to worry about jerking wires or knocking things around. Wireless charging is my new favorite 🤩
","
The one thing I don't like about this charger is when its plugged in the light on the top is always on.  I prefer the device to only light up when there is an item being charged like a when you place a phone on it, for the first few seconds.  This means the device is always using power as long as its plugged in. Regardless if we are charging a device or not.
","
I have never thought of using a wireless charger for my phone. When I saw the charger and it was small and thin, it looked perfect to fit on top of my small table. It charges fast and is the perfect size. I loved the price also.
","
Solo hay que conectar un cargador de carga rápida y todo perfecto pero cumple con su funcion
","
Beautiful design, very thin.... charges well. Since it's used on night stand, I wish the light would activate only for a few seconds and then turn off while charging.
","
This is one of items that I bought on Amazon where I felt I got more in return than what I paid for, which is a great feeling as a customer. Unit is aesthetically pleasing, and functions great. I have tried a few different wireless chargers, and this one charges at the fastest rate. Only inconvenience part is you really have to center your phone in the middle of the unit or else it won't charge, but that is a similar issue you see in other chargers as well, this one is just a bit more picky on placement than others. Overall, a great buy, and I recommend.
","
It's a great idea to be able to charge your phone without having to remember to plug it in. For some reason it and my phone gets really hot. It doesn't work everytime either for some reason.
","
Works okay, the plug type is a C which is better than the micro usb
","
close to my chair
","
You know, at $11, you can't go wrong. Not being techno savvy, I just discovered my IPhone SE is wireless charging capable. I bought one of these, and liked it so much I bought 2 more just to have around the house. It even comes in colors, so it can benefit your mood, gender, whatever. Love them!

 The sleek, thin, and lightweight design combined with the well-placed status lights on both sides of the face give off the notion of a well-designed wireless charger - and you wouldn't be wrong. Not only is it pleasing to the eye, but the functionality is on par to cable charging as well. Wireless fast charging works flawlessly and charges my phone as quickly as when using a cable. The rubber grips on the bottom of the charger also work well in preventing it from sliding around wherever you place it. Additionally, the charger is very lightweight while still maintaining a tough, compact feel.The only downside to this charger is that, given the design, smudges can easily occur on the face when placing your phone or handling it. This is not something that's purely the fault of the charger and does not take away from functionality, but something to consider.Additionally, the semi-reflective surface may not be for everyone, though personally I find it adds to the ascetics.Pros:* Ascetically pleasing design.* Fast charging works flawlessly* Thin and lightweight* Good rubber grips on bottomCons:*Smudges can easily occur on the face
","
Great charging and not in the way on the nightstand
","
This is my first wireless charger, but I’ve wanted one for quite a while. I got it to use with my iPhone XS Max, which I tested just before writing this review and it works perfectly. The charging surface is completely covered in a soft, matte rubber, and the bottom has two non-slip rubber feet. There is also a green LED (which you can see in the product description) that turns blue when you’re charging something. It’s otherwise a very simple, sturdy construction that should last quite a while provided you don’t use it play hockey or something. The rose gold also matches the Apple Rose Gold almost perfectly, so if that’s aesthetic, you should be quite pleased. I personally think it’s quite clean-looking.Incidentally, this doesn’t just work with a phone; any device capable of wireless charging should work.
","
I love the size. It works great. It is fully compatible with my tozo wireless earbuds. Excellent charge. Disappointed my I watch won’t charge on it.
","
Completely worth the money. Just get it
","
Edit: Tozo kindly reached out to me and offered a free replacement item, I guess as a result of my initial review.I fired it up and tested it, and it does work through my Defender case.However, I do use another brand of charger, daily, and don't use the Tozo.This charger does make a very nice appearance.Original review: However, after being powered up and looking normal for 12-24 hours, and before charging my phone, I started to get a flashing LED, which is neither addressed in the microscopically printed multilingual user manual, nor the support section of their website, and no response from support.Cycling power cleared that mystery flashing LED.Now, I see that this charger does not like my Otterbox Defender case, which I do like very much.So, it looks like the case will win this battle.BTW, my Anker charging pad has no trouble with this same configuration.
","
I was going to give this product a bad review because it did not work. There was a green light when I plugged it in, but when I put my phone on it - it just flashed green and did not charge the phone. So went to the Apple store and bought a more expensive wireless charger. Guess what - it did not work either. The guy at the Apple store just rebooted my phone and now both of my new wireless chargers work. I actually like this one better because you can instantly see that the phone is charging because the lights turn purple. If you don't want to see the lights at night - just position your phone over them. Now I will use this one at home and the other for travel.
","
I was hoping for something that was clean and reduced the long typical cord I have to charge my phone. My phone connects well but it doesn't do high speed charging. I haven't tried it overnight to see how it might charge because I rely on my phone for work. I have plugged it while I'm working on my computer and so maybe because I lift it occasionally from the plate it doesn't have constant contact. I would not purchase this again, instead opting for a portable charger.*Update: the company is offering me a $20 gift certificate to improve my review but I would rather keep my honest opinion here. I don’t trust the device to charge my phone and would never place it bedside to charge overnight because it might not charge. In fact, I had it charging at my desk for an hour and my phone moved from 23% to 25. I moved it to my donation pile after that. This whole process of review has made me a little wary of reviews now. How many are true?*
","
The product arrived in nice packaging that was easy to open. A simple quick start guide covers the basics.  It included a usb-a to usb-c cable to power the device. Please note that you need to provide your own usb power supply in order to achieve high speed charging.  If you use a Samsung phone then you need a 10w power supply, apple products will fast charge with a 5w power supply.  The unit is compatible with all wireless charging capable devices, headphones, tablets, smartphones, etc... just use the correct power supply fir your devices current.  The build quality is excellent and it packs neatly into a handbag or backpack.  The LED indicator on the front illuminates green when power is applied and changed to blue while charging.  The top of the charger has a textured pad to prevent your device from slipping off.
","
This certainly has uncluttered things for me. I’m unsure as to how it is insofar as traveling with it is concerned. The heat generated by charging my iPhone is a little concerning. My nightstand’s surface before charging was 72.7°F and the charger was 74.4°F. Charging the phone, the heat was transferred differently with the upper and lower portions of my iPhone. The top of the iPhone was 85.8°F and the bottom was 82.8°F and the charger was 88.1°F. I don’t know if the heat is something to be concerned with or not. The charger is a lot easier than having to plug the lightning connector in though.
","
UPDATE: I noticed if my phone got hot, the charging pad wouldn't work.  Also, even though when my lightning cord it said ""fast charging"" on my phone, it still charged at the speed of a normal cord.  Overall, I determined using my cord worked just as well and ended up returning it.  Not necessarily a bad product, just wasn't overall what I was looking for.**I love that this has a non-slip backing - I have it on the edge of my standing desk so it is out of the way but still accessible. It's nice to know I won't accidentally push it off the edge. It charges my wireless earbud case and my Samsung phone with no issues. It's really compact and thin so it's footprint is fairly small, and it comes with a decent size charging cord length. The charging cord it comes with is not a lightning, but I can plug the cord I already have in and it converts to a fast charging pad. It has a USB-C port.
","
Seriously awesome. My husband lovessss it. The only thing I wish is that it came with a charging brick.
","
First wireless charger that I have tried that worked as advertised.
","
This product works fine as an overnight charger if I can get the phone placed on it in just the right spot, if not it switched on and off until I get it repositioned. I have an iPhone 12, which I’ve read generally has to be placed just right on any wireless charger, but this one is more difficult than others I’ve used. It does take several hours to reach a full charge, also not a problem with other wireless chargers. Doesn’t seem to overheat the way some other wireless charges do though.
","
I’ve gotten quite a few wireless chargers from Amazon and all either didn’t work from the beginning or they stopped working after a short period of time. This one actually works! And continues to work! It charges through my WALLET phone case with 3 cards in it all all times and I’ve had both of mine for a over a year now still going strong.
","
The roie gold color is hidden when the device is being used. It is smaller and lighter than the ones in using; so excellent for traveling.
","
This little thing is the most simple one of its kind that you can find.  It could not be more simple.  It is seriously just so good looking and so easy.  I put mine on a dark black/gray granite nightstand.  It totally blends in and I can just see the silver rim on the circle.  So THIN!  And the smooth shiny surface is nice compared to ugly plastic thick ones like Belkin.  Some people mention the lights annoying them at night.  I like them, not only is it a demarcation to aim for in the dark to set your phone down on, but you can just set your phone so that it covers the illuminated lights too!  It works both ways.  This is like my best purchase on Amazon all year so far.  I am glad I did a thorough job researching like I always do, but no need on this one.  Just get it.  I am a person who likes to hold my iPhone without a case to appreciate the quality of the intended design.  This feels like you want to hold it too, :D.
","
This is my first wireless charging pad.  The pad is attractive, clean looking, sturdy, and has nice lights that indicate ready to charge and charging in progress. It is slim and doesn't take up a lot of space, and the green lights when not in-use double as a night light.  I don't know if there is a 'Super Fast Wireless Charging', as there is a Super Fast Charge when plugged into the wired charger, and with the advertised wattage I thought it might.  But it still does the Fast Charging using the older 'Fast Charger' but using the new one doesn't make it charge faster.Still, it is very convenient to be able to charge my phone by just placing it centered on the pad (and the LEDs tell me if it is askew) and not needing to plug it in or unplug it to pick it up and walk away.
","
This is a very well built product that completely suits my needs at a very good price. I think that the lighting scheme is very informative and simple. It also is very easy to start the charging process unlike my old one (from Verizon) that had to have my phone in ""the perfect position"" to get it to charge.
","
Of course, this has to be plugged in to an electrical socket so it is not as handy as my portable charger. It does not charge any faster than any other charger, but the convenience is in just laying your phone down on it and not having to plug it in.
","
Two of the three charges work very well.  I simply place my iPhone 11 on the plate and the light turns form green to blue to indicate that it's charging.  Works the same with my AirPod wireless charging case.  However, one to the places will quit working when charging overnight.  Not sure why, some nights it works perfectly.  Going to try a different charger to see if that might be the problem.  Will update this note tomorrow.1/14/21 Update:  the third charging plate is working fine.  It must have been a problem with the charging plug that caused it to quite before completing the charge overnight.
","
Perfect spare wireless charger to charge my earbuds
","
I would read this product a 3.7/5. And the reason why I rated it that is because it charges very slow for an iPhone. Like it took five hours for it to charge and it was on 80% and not only that but the charging cable is really short which can make it difficult if you put it on your dresser if it’s longer than 30 inches tall. I’m also going to mention that at the bottom it has grips for you put it down and it doesn’t slide which has been helpful. And if you have an iPhone and the case is on it won’t charge do the case you have to take the case off in order for it to be charged or else it’s gonna keep disconnecting from your phone. So the only thing that I use this charger for is for my Bluetooth headphones which is the only thing that has worked out great for this device. So I think I’ll just use it for only that but not my phone.

It’ss little slow but it works. For the price I’m happy with it.

I purchased a Belkin charging pad, but when I set my 12mini on the Belkin charging pad, I have to shift it around for the charging to begin, arrrrgggghhhh!  With this charging pad, I set my phone on it, and it immediately begins charging.  It is thin, easy to use, and easy to transport.  I purchased the rose gold color, but know the color is only evident on the thin rim of the device and the bottom, which you don't see.The device lights up green when not in use but plugged into a USB energy source and blue when charging a device.  I considered purchasing another, but as of now, I have no need. But if someone asked where to get one, I would most definitely recommend this product.  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THE AT&T STORE, PURCHASE IT HERE AND SAVE MONEY.

This is my first time entering the wireless charging world as I just got a new phone that can accept it. So I saw this one and figured it would be a nice looking one to go for. I’ve had it maybe a month now and so far so good! Of course it charges slower than plugging it up but the low profile gives it a sleek look and feels closer to feeling like I’m just sitting the phone on my nightstand. I’ve noticed other wireless chargers don’t stay lit at all times, this one does and I’m seeing that to be a benefit, because at night when I’m searching for the device, it’s nice to spot the little green semi-circles in the dark so I know where to line the phone up to, then the semi-circles change to blue. Neither color is too bright to sleep beside. Also I’ve noticed that when I accidentally give it a static shock, apparently there’s an internal safety measure that resets the device as if I just plugged it in the wall. So that’s good to know a simple static shock won’t kill it. Overall good purchase, I do recommend!
","
the product works & it works well, especially for the price. love that it changes color when it is charging so you know it is working & stops charging once it hits full battery.  super thankful for the non-slip pads on the bottom. have not had any issues yet. unsure of the longevity of the charger. i have had it for about 2 months and have not yet had any issues *knock on wood* -- for the price i would definitely say just buy it.
","
I had a different kind of charger...a disc kind but it stood up and when I bought a new phone that was larger, it kept falling off.  I used it at night so this was very inconvenient. I had one of these in my home office and I really liked it....it had worked with my previous phone but worked even better with my new phone.  So I ordered another.  With my smaller phone I had some issues with getting the phone placed in the right spot to charge but not with my new bigger android phone.  It starts charging right away and charges fast too.  I haven't traveled with it but I think it will be great for traveling.
","
I didn’t think I’d need a charger for my new iPhone 11, but the value for the convenience of this charger was well worth the investment. If you have wireless earbuds and are running out of battery, fear not. The phone easily remains charged while you sit and relax on your phone call wherever you like within Bluetooth distance. I no longer loose my phone, charger cords, or worry about frayed wires because it sits easily in a convenient location whenever it needs charging and I put it in plain sight. I haven’t lost my phone since I bought this charger. It’s sleek and takes up very little room. I looked at a lot of chargers, and though I’m partial to the futuristic aluminum color, it’s as if I don’t have to worry about my phone anymore when I’m in my house.
","
It works well

This is a very nice inductive charger.  The USB ""C"" cable is included with the charger, so set-up requires nothing more than to plug the cable into a charger and into the pad...it is ready to go.The photos show about all you need to know:  The green, illuminated, arcs on the pad indicate that is ready to use; the arcs change to blue when charging; the charger works with a phone in a case with a button on the back.  Although, there is apparently a limit to the thickness of the case through which the pad can charge.The phone in the photos is a Samsung S7 and the button holds the phone 6mm from the surface of the pad.  The pad works fine in this situation.The last photo shows the iconography on the face of the wall charger being used to drive the pad.  Either of the ports in the charger works well and produces the same rate-of-charge from the pad.Final thoughts:  Nice looking charge pad that functions well and is easy to use.  Fine by me!
","
So far I'm loving this charger quite a bit. I've had a couple other wireless chargers and if the phone wasnt in the exact spot it wouldnt charge, or wouldnt charge very fast.This is a simple, lightweight, very cool looking wireless charger that does exactly what its suppose to and at a really good speed. I've found a flat charger is the way to go no matter what you are charging as it is a lot more universal than the propped up charger so fiscally it's a better way to go. And for any amount of travel, now experiencing this I cant go back to Tetrising stuff. It's so sleek storing it for travel couldnt be easier, its thinner than a book. I couldnt be happier with it and at a respectable cost.
","
I like this little guy, and he was cheap. But, the lights on it stay on all the time, so it's basically worthless to me since I planned on using it as a bedside charger and I prefer to sleep in a completely dark room. Having a glow beam me in the eyes all night is no bueno.
","
Does what it says. Great for the price. We have three
","
I like having the ability of charging my phone wirelessly and this works great with mine. I can also charge my earbuds. Supports fast charge and has a standard usb adapter. Recommended.
","
Inexpensive multifunctional charger.  Works with my IPhone although bought it to charge my ear buds, which as it turns out, have their own case and charging cord.
","
Easy to plug in obviously... the provided USB to USB-C does not fast charge. At 15%, it takes 2.5 hours to charge with provided cord. With my USB-C block, USB-C to USB-C cord, it takes 2 hours. With my USB-C block and cord directly plugged into my phone, no wireless charger, it takes 55 minutes. Bought this to charge my phone while i use it in its folded position facing any direction and to pick up/put down as needed without dealing with a plug, not to lose charge.
","
The charger works well but there is a bright green/blue light (standby/charging) light that does not turn off. It's drawing power (albeit likely very small amounts) at all times, but more importantly is very bright when trying to sleep, even if your phone is on top of the charger. If you think this will be bothersome, find a different product.
","
The Tozo wireless charger looks and works great and charges my Samsung S10 very quickly, looks classy and feels sturdy. I am very happy with it and will recommend it to my friends and family!!
","
Sometimes you get a product that you think is probably just going to be so so because of the price being so low.This is not one of those. It is very well made and effective at wireless charging.
","
My initial thought was 5 minutes into owning this, and it was that it was perfect for me with Note8 and a PureGear case. But that quickly faded when I realized that even though the blue light was on, and my phone said it was charging, it was in fact NOT charging. I removed the case, and that didn't change anything. I then switched between multiple AC adapters, and that didn't make a difference. So, now am at square one working on a return.The company has sent a replacement very quickly though.
","
I just recently discovered the advantages and ease of using a wireless charger for my iPhone and purchased this Tozo charger. It works great - it's easy, convenient and quick. I would recommend it to anyone. One slight drawback is the charging cable has a regular sized USB end that fits into an adaptor (no problem) and the micro USB size that fits into the charger itself. I thought that would also be no problem and, in fact, figured I had plenty of other same sized cables. This wasn't the case, however, because the end that fits into the charger (and the opening in the charger) is a slightly different size than all my other cables. Not a problem as long as the cable that came with the charger keeps working and/or isn't lost. Other than that, the charger works great!
","
I use this on my Google pixel 6 and it works great! it charges my phone in no time and it's very easy to transport... it's small and durable and it looks and feels of high quality. very good product... I highly recommend it to anyone.

This product delivers a reliable charge in a very reasonable amount of time. I’ve only owned one other Qi wireless charger and this product is very comparable to that one as far as the charge. Where this one surpasses my previous charger (for me personally) is it’s sleek, thin, space-conserving design, and it’s color change indicating charging vs. charged. I bought two of them. One sits on my desk and the other on my night stand. At first my wife and I were worried that the light would be too bright for a dark room while we were trying to fall asleep, but we find it to be no issue. I also appreciate the color change differentiating between charging and charged...I also use this charger for my Tozo wireless headphones, so product versatility is always a good thing. Bottom line: if you’re looking for a wireless charger that consumes very little space, delivers a reliable charge, and very clearly communicates charging vs. charged, then you’ve found your product.

Game Changer. My Samsung has a censor for Moisture. It refuses a USB charger. It literally will not allow you to insert a USB into the charge port. Your basically phone less. I've read, I've watched hacks how to rid the censor, turning it off, nothing works, I did not get my phone wet. My phone has had a Moisture Warning now for 7 weeks! The 1 percent battery left weeks ago, This disc charger arrived, I set my phone on it, The Charging began effectively. If the battery is off dead, I'm not sure this is able to ignite your phone.I love this Charger. Don't invest in a Samsung, get the free one from your provider, this censor locking you out of charging is BS.
","
EDIT: CUSTOMER SERVICE has reached out and is sending me a new one! I will post a final update after it’s been here for a bit! Great that they reached out!Let me start by saying, I loved this thing! Super easy to use, a fast charge, and super nice looking!Fast forward to yesterday... I set my phone on it to charge while I was cooking and when I picked it up, there was a huge dent and cracks. I never was rough with it and am so disappointed that it broke so easily!Too late to return, I suppose as I’ve had it a bit over a month. Super sad as I had planned to get a few more for the house!
","
These chargers are perfect to have laying around the house!
","
A beautiful product that does what it says. There are just enough lights on it to let you know what is happening - green=ready to charge, blue=charging. In the photo, the green lights are greener than they appear and turn blue when charging. Drop your phone on the disc and let it charge. I have my phone in a thin silicone case and this provides just enough tackiness to keep the phone from sliding. Charging through the case is no problem.Mine does not have TOZO logo in the middle like the product image shows. Based on the description I didn't expect a cord, but there is a ~4 foot cord with USB-C on one end (plugs into the disc charger) and a traditional USB-A on the other end. It easily connects to your laptop or wall charger or user-supplied AC adapter.
","
Convenient and easy to use for wireless headphone charging. Charging phones wirelessly works, but even with my ""super fast"" charger plugged in, my phone doesn't go into ""super fast"" charging mode. Still convenient, but not a quick change for phone if in a hurry.

I have a set of headphones I use to charge this with and it works great, charges phones like any other wireless charger, I don’t use them often for my phone. I work on boats and this is nice to travel around with just need a cube and it’s ready to go comes with a cable to I recommend a longer one. Other than that works great looks great no complains after 2-3 months of use

 I love it and one of my iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t work with the core so this work great for it
","
Beautiful well made charger.  Looks like it is well made and I loved the silver accents on white.  The only problem is it didn't work with my Samsung note 9....it might work with more modern phones.
","
The unit looks good. My one complaint is it does my charge at the faster rates that my phone can handle. Using the same USB charger & cable, my phone says a full charge in 40 minutes and when using the wireless charger, it is 50 minutes. I guess it is better than the 75 minutes with the old-style USB cable with the ""C"" adapter installed.
","
It was extremely easy out of the box, litterally just plug it in and your done. Slightly annoying to fiddle with to get the phone placement just right to charge.
","
I bought this since it said it worked with Samsung series phones.  This may or may not be true, but it doesn't work with the Galaxy S21.
","
When I recently purchased some new wireless earbuds for myself, there was an offer where I could also get this wireless charger, and receive an additional discount.  Seemed like a good way to give wireless charging a try since both phones used in our household support wireless charging.  I'd never bit the bullet because our phones (Google Pixel model phones) have some slight difference than other phones, so the charging speed may be slower.  I ordered this with my earbuds, figuring I'd give this to my husband as a random gift.  It arrived a few days ago, he was very happily surprised & after he tried it out, he loved it so much that he asked me to order a 2nd one so he can use it at the office & will keep one at home.
","
I’ve bought many wireless chargers in the past that seemed good from the reviews/picture but when they show up they feel cheap and break within a month. This charger surpassed my expectations the minute I took it out of the box. It had good weight and felt well built. It’s also super simple and does the job it needs to. A+
","
It doesn’t charge as fast as I want it too but it is pretty small. It also is very easy to use.
","
I love the look and I love the lights that make it easy to tell if it’s charging or not. It worked well with my wife’s iPhone and she has a thin case and a pop socket and it was charging through that. I have a thin case with a metal ring that works like a collapsible pop socket and it wouldn’t charge mine without taking the case off.My only complaint though is that the wireless earbuds I got my wife for Xmas got hot while charging. The case was on for like 20 min and got so hot that it burned her hand to the touch. I wanted to see if this was a thing, so I plugged that same case into a normal USB wire charger in another room and it never got hot at all. So, then I tested my wife’s phone again on the wireless circle and it was a little hot on the pop socket after about 10 min.So, it works and it charges, but beware how hot it gets doing so.
","
Connected to my Galaxy S10's charger, it does not fast charge as advertised.Despite that flaw, I love the convenience of leaving the charging pad plugged on my nightstand and just plopping my phone down when I go to bed, not having to fumble around for the cable in the dark. The subtle green glow on the surface makes it easy to see, but isn't bright enough to bother me. And since it charges while I sleep, I don't mind if it takes 2 hours instead of 30 minutes. I also use it for my earbuds, and as wireless charging becomes more prevalent, I'm sure I'll find more convenient uses.4 Stars for convenience, minus 1 for no fast charging.
","
just what I needed
","
I liked this product. Easy to use and worked right away.
","
I purchased this wireless charger about a month ago as a gift. My parents both use it and it works well. It’s more convenient than plugging and unplugging the charging cord every time, and there’s less wear-and-tear on the cord. This charger has no on/off switch, so I purchased an outlet extender with a power switch to make it even easier and to avoid wasting electricity.

This was my first wireless dock charger and really enjoy it. It's smaller compared to the ones that my friends have so it doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk which I love. The dock has a sleek glass-like top that doesn't seem to get all covered with fingerprints, and the docking lights give it that extra snazzy'ness but doesn't overwhelm and brighten your room up at night. The lights change colors so you know if it is charging your electronics.If I had to say one negative thing, it wouldn't even be about the charger itself. I just wish the power cord was just a bit longer. It fits just fine for its current desk location but you need to have an outlet in the immediate area. I'd just say its a .1% problem for someone that needs to stretch that extra space.
","
It was a gift and loved it!!
","
I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S10 because my charging cord connection doesn't work anymore. With the proper plug it fast-charges the phone in a good amount of time. It's very sleek and tucks away easily in a bag if you need to take it with you. I've brought it with me to work and successfully hooked it up to my power bank. It's a great little charger.
","
My husband got this for me. It worked great until it stopped charging. I left it charging all night only to find out it was dead in the morning when my alarm didn’t go off. I’m not sure if my phone was placed wrong or what but I tried charging it again in the morning for a couple of mins and it still wouldn’t turn on so I plugged in the cord instead and charged it that way. It worked really good at first but not sure why it stopped working.
","
Item was okay for the first few days then it started charging my phone slow I mean really slow to the point where I left it on over night and only had 16 percent
","
For the price of these things they are hard to beat. They looks good and feel very sturdy. Mine have lasted a whopping year so far which far outlasts most electronics these days. They appear the be solid metal and glass. Heavy and durable feeling. Not cheap plastic feeling like everything else. The lights do glow at night if you are using near your bed, but if you either flip them over or out a phone on to charge the lights are not an issue. I’m very sensitive to light when I sleep and these do not bother me.
","
Originally I bought this to use with my XS Max, they worked brilliantly, however since I’ve upgraded to the 12 Pro Max it turns out they do not work some reason. The lights will change as if it’s charging, however the phone will never actually start charging. Super disappointed to not be able to use these any longer. I’ve only had them a few months.Update: Seller reached out and sent two new chargers as they felt it was a case of defective product, still no luck charging the Pro Max with these new ones either, but the customer service is stellar and deserving of consideration.
","
This charging pad is VERY easy to use and the slim design is attractive, if you do not mind the low level glow of the green light (turns blue while charging).NOTE: This is NOT a “wireless” power bank charger that you can carry along to charge anywhere. It ONLY charges when plugged i a USB/electrical source. The initial product description (and website reviews) were misleading and it took 4-5 email exchanges with customer service to clarify this limitation.As I purchased it for a bedside table this is not a problem, though it is not appropriate for “travel” use as depicted in some ads.
","
Love that I can just pop my NC2's on the charger and forget em and they charge and then shut off so they don't overcharge! Thin and compact, like the flat black it's a little soft so it's not slippery. It looks good too! BUY with confidence.
","
so having a wireless charger is nice but if you want to keep this next to your bed for your convenience be aware that the led light that indicates it's not charged is blue and it's the worst color for when you're trying to sleep. You could always cover the lights with your phone but be aware. it's still a nice charger with a good design.
","
Had this charger for just over a week now and I’m very happy with it! Real value for money. Sleek, high-end design, looks way more expensive than it is. Not cheap, lightweight plastic at all. Looks and feels very premium finishing. The rubberized shaped grips, helps to prevent any errant swishes from pushing my phone around. And of course there are rubberized feet on the bottom as well, it's very stable on my desk. It lights up blue when the phone is placed on the surface, then the smoothie ness of its led lights’s a real nice touch, it flashes for a few seconds when you first set your phone down so you know it’s charging. The connection port is a fast charging USB-C adapter with the proper power supply It will fast charge (which is a piece of cake).Considering the build quality as well as for the extremely reasonable price I’m glad for decided to buy this TOZO Wireless charger. I can’t hardly wait to buy another one for at home.I have nothing bad to say about this product. Charges my iPhone XMax with a case on it with no problems.
","
I wish the lights were smaller, but it works great. Just a 'dot' would be plenty for a light charging indicator...or dim them. Way too bright...ughs!
","
The charger works as advertised. It charged my iPhone and my AirPods fully and stopped automatically. I have two minor negative observations. The photos in the product reviews showed 2 crescents  of light on the pad surface in addition to the tiny led light on the side of the charger. Apparently, not all models have those extra surface lights. I ordered the gray model and I didn't realize it didn't have the lights. Other minor issue: the plug that plugs into the device is the older, larger plug. Not a big deal. I just have to remember to take the correct cable when traveling.
","
This wireless charger works really good. Reliable. Put the phone on it and you can be sure it will keep charging. Others I have had start charging but as soon as I walked away something happened and the charging stopped. Not this one. Design is quality. I have bought a few of them now and leave in different places around the house were I regularly set my phone down. I put on in my car and now have a wireless charger in the little cubby-hole. Love it. Very good. Highly recommend this one.
","
It looks like something out of Star Trek! It charges my Samsung galaxy s10 plus in about 2.5 hours with a fast charger power brick connected to it, longer if you use a regular power brick that isn't a fasr charger. It's thin and lightweight so you can carry it around with ease. It comes with a short USB-C power cable, so if you need a longer cord you gotta provide one. You also have to provide your own power brick. I gave it 4 stars because it should charge faster than it does, especially with a fast charger connected to it. It works good though!
","
Brand new phone and adapter not able to pull the advertised charge speed but it does enough.
","
Charging good. Slim and look nice.
","
I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. When 8 first put the phone on the wireless charger, it says ""fast wireless charging"" and then immediately reverts to regular wireless charging. After some research online, this seems to be the case with most Samsung phone users and any wireless charger that's not Samsung  brand. Dumb. No fault of the product itself here.
","
Muy bueno y bonito, el único problema (con Samsung)es que la marca al no ser verificado por Samsung evita que se use la carga rápida así que no te molestes en un adaptador 3.0 si tienes Samsung ya que en si el teléfono evitará que se active la carga rápida por seguridad.
","
Update: the company is going to send me a replacement since I received a faulty one the first time! This is a great company to invest in :).This product WAS great! It charged super fast and was very convenient to use since you just lay your phone on it. However, I got this literally a few months ago on January 23, 2021 and it’s already not working.. the light changes from green to blue when you know it’s started to charge your phone and now it’s not charging at all and the light doesn’t change from green. No matter what position I place my phone, it doesn’t charge it. I’ve tried to unplug and plug it back in, nothing works to fix this problem.
","
It’s very flat and has a nice, wide diameter, which is what a wireless charger should be. It’s a very sleek design and charges the phone at a reasonable speed. My problem is the light always being on, even if it’s not in contact with a phone.The manufacturer should specify that this is the case. Either that or charge a couple more bucks for an on/off switch for the light. I’d pay for that feature.  I suppose this is OK to put in an area of the house where you might want a night light, but the light always being on makes it unusable as a charger you place next to your bed.
","
Great product!!! I have a galaxy a50 so I had to purchase the qi adapter (from another seller) to use this. The a50 doesnt come with wireless charging capabilities. I didnt realize until just now that the charging plate does not come with cord needed to utilize ""fast charging"" mode. But since it takes a usb/type C cord that was easy enough to fix! I do have one question I haven't yet found an answer to. A couple times when I set phone down led lights on plate do a bit of a strobe deal with 2 different blues ??? Now If I have phone slightly off from the X on the qi adapter the phone comes up with ""slow charging! Check if cable is broken""  This is a wonderful product, exactly as described. So reasonably priced,  and design is very sleek and pleasing to have out. Especially compared to all those ugly cords we all hate. FYI, I also purchased the TOZO wireless earbuds T10 and the plate works great for charging these too.
","
I love the size and the lights that are on the unit, but there is one issue.  The lights will change to charging, once the phone is placed on the pad, but it may not be charging the phone.  The pad is a lot larger than the last one I had, but the phone has to be centered to be charging.  Just make sure the phone says charging on it also, in addition to the lights changing different colors on the charging base.  Otherwise, great product!
","
It charges my phone and ear buds
","
Slick, nice and looks like a nice coaster. Works well but don’t know about the fast charge

After rearranging my office desk, I found myself placing my phone in the same place everyday, and decided it would be nice to be able to charge it while it sat there. I did some research on Amazon, and settled on this TOZO wireless charger. I liked the compact size and sleek design, and the claims of build quality. I'm not disappointed on any account. The unit is small but hefty, and the mirror finish and aluminum accents are visually pleasing. Charge performance is on par with other units I've used before, which is a good thing. If you're considering using this TOZO on your nightstand, please note that there are two green lights that remain on when the charger is empty, and which change to blue lights while the phone is charging. The lights are small enough and arranged in such a way that you can place your phone over them while charging and hide the lights completely if you prefer a dark room. Another plus is the inclusion of a USB-C cable, rather than the Micro-USB that some reviews mentioned. Overall a great charger at a fair price.
","
I bought this for my wife's I-phone 6S plus after it went in the bathtub and then wouldn't take the lightning cable plunge.  Saw 6s in the list but it wasn't for an i-phone.  I don't think any of these work for that phone.Keeping it for convenience as it works great with my iphone 11.Thought that I read that it worked without the cable once charged, but I don't think that's true.  Not much instructions with it.

Well packaged and quick shipment. Bought to replace an anklet wireless charger. The unit works wells, and is holds the power cord securely. The top portion is around a 1mm thick piece of aluminum. The one I purchase is black and has a mirror finish. It is attached to a plastic body with anti skid feet. It is very sturdy. I have used both an IPhone and Wireless Earbuds without any issues. Charging was fast. Their is a lighted indicator to let you know that it is working when you place a device on the unit. Overall, a solid unit that does what it is supposed to. Have tried to place change on the unit to see if it would overheat and it did not even turn on and must have the correct safety device. I would recommend this item and willPost an update after an extended use of the item. It comes with a 1 Year Warranty.
","
The TOZO W1 is a device that has style, performance, and solid construction.Hold it your hand, and feel the metallic heft, not plastic. The style and finish is in the standard of the best devices by Apple and Samsung.The charging works exactly as designed - drop the device needing charge on the top, and the lights start to pulse and indicate that the device is charging.It has a USB-C port, and can use a multiple volt/ampere power transformer (Wall Wart) at 5V 9V and 12V input, for devices faster than the base 5V current.Overall, I like the TOZO W1, and I can recommend it!
","
Only downside is I can't use it with my metal ring style grip. (Causes it to heat up) Faster charging than my cords! Neat to set visitors phones on and have them go ""I didn't even know my phone could DO that!"" 😁
","
If you are like me and believe in thoughtful purchasing, you might have a list much like mine with boxes that need to be ticked before making that purchase. Basically, I don't like buying junk. Not only does it waste my time and money, its just more stuff to fill up the landfill. Why am I saying this on this wireless charger review? Because it is not junk. This charger is a quality product, that appears it will last me many years to come. The stylish design definitely helps! The functionality of this charger is simple; it charges your smart phone, AirPods, anything that can be charged wirelessly just by placing the electronic on top of the charger between the lighted guides. The lights change color based on ready, charging, and charged. If you are sensitive to light while sleeping, I'd recommend keeping this farther away from your bed as possible. The light is not obnoxious but for a sensitive sleeper, it might be intrusive. Overall, I really love this charger, and I hope to use it for a long time.
","
It definitely charge my phone to a 100
","
I really like this charger. It's not a fast charger, but it charges my Pixel 3 reasonably fast enough. I have had much slower chargers.However, it's the wide base that really makes it shine. I don't have to ever fiddle with it to find the charging spot. I just set it down between the lights and it finds it every time.The lights are easy to see around the phone so I can easily see where to put it and the change of light color lets me know if it's still charging without picking up the phone (also sometimes let's me know it's on the charger right before my phone let's me know).As I said, not a fast charger, but I'm okay with that. I usually keep it in my home office so I have other things to do so my phone can take a little longer (not much longer, though, its not a slow charger!) in charging. And the ease of use makes the time a non issue anyway. I totally recommend.

This one is life changer for me now i don't have to worry about plug in plug out i can just put my phone on it while working. Love it
","
Low profile and holds well.Biggest detractor is the cord is hard wired into the wireless charger.  But everything else is perfect
","
It is a nice looking charger and does charger my phone but it isn't compatible with my Samsung S21 fast charging.  If I plug the same cable straight into my phone I more than double the charging speed I get when I use the wireless charging pad.--Update: charger stopped working all together a few weeks ago, it lasted about 8 months all together which i think isnt to bad considering its price point so i will keep my original 4 star rating.
","
For too long, I ve been fussing with plug charging cables that often disconnect between. Middle charge. Maybe it’s my charger port on my iPhone 12. Whatever. What an easy way to put the damn wires behind.I ordered a Tozo brand because I love my earbuds I got from Tozo. Their products seem to be a cut above all others.
","
Very slow charging. If you work in an office and leave your phone on the charger, then this is for you.
","
D works fine but does not seem to charge any faster than any other charger
","
It charges my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20+ fine, but this charging pad will not charge my Samsung earbuds case. I have a different wireless charger which works just fine with my earbuds case so it's not that big a deal, but it would have been nice to have the flexibility to charge it with this pad as well.
","
Does what it supposed. I have a bulky case and was still able to charge through the case. I don’t know how fast it charges but so far I’m satisfied with the charging speed. Love the color because it matches my furniture and doesn’t take much space. The cable that comes with it was too short for me since there’s no power outlet where I place the charger at. I just got a longer cable so not an issue. The cable length is just standard size. It just doesn’t work for me where I’m placing the charger at.
","
Great charger with very high speed charging. I am using it with the new Apple 20 watt USB-C charging block. Only issue is that you need a cable with USb-C on both ends, to use with the Apple 20 watt charing block that has USB-C output. Had to order USB-c to USB-C for this to work, but after that it has fast charging. Also very sleek and think so not impposing setting on a surface. Bought 5 more after trying one.
","
This charger from Tozo is very effective at doing its job, whether that may be charging your phone or your earbud case. It is nice and small, therefore easy to find a place to put it, the adverse effects of this negated by the magnet. The charging speed is comparable to a wired charger, though not on the level of fast-charging by any means. However, the main reason I would recommend this is for ease of use and convenience, and it charges fairly efficiently compared to previous iterations of the wireless charger. The packaging was beautiful just like any of the other electronics from this company, and the design of the actual charger was quite sleek, conveniently coming with a USB to USB-c adapter.
","
Note that this unit does NOT come with a USB cable and plug. But they are pointing this out in the description. This charger is very thin. It has an indicator light at the top that shows you if it is charging, ""kind of charging"" or finished charging. I am not quite sure how fast it is charging as I use it to charge the phone overnight. However, my Galaxy S10 never complains about slow charging so it seems to be alright. The only a little ""tricky"" think is putting the phone on the charger. It has to be somewhat precise or it doesn't charge properly. I suspect that's the case with other chargers as well (not sure, though) hence I am not taking any points off. All in all I am very satisfied with this charger.
","
Works great I love it. 5 ⭐️‘S
","
I got my previous wireless charger years ago when they were ""new"" technology.  Can't believe how much better the newest ones are. Sleek and easy to use. Almost wish my old one had stopped working sooner!
","
I recently bought my wife a Google Pixel 4 for her birthday and, since the Pixel 4 supports wireless charging, bought this charger to go with it since the charger lists that it is compatible with the Pixel series.  The product itself is very well made and worked great the first time we used it.  It charged almost as fast as the normal fast-charge cable that comes with the Pixel series and got her phone from about 20% to 90% in about 45 minutes.Unfortunately, after that first charge, it has not worked again.  We have had the charger for about 2 weeks now and tried the phone with and without case, facing in different directions (yes we know the coil has a specific orientation in order to work correctly), using different cables, plugging it into different outlets, etc.  The only other time I was able to get the phone to charge was after removing the case and turning the phone off, it charged for about 20% but otherwise stopped working.  The charger does seem to be recognizing the phone - when plugged in the lights are green and when the phone is sitting on it correctly oriented the lights are blue - but it is definitely not charging.I don't know if we just got a dud or what, but I had moderate hopes for this charger based on the overall high ratings and so far am disappointed with what we got.
","
I bought 4 of these to gift to my family members after reading all the amazing reviews. What I love most is it charges such a variety of phone cases. It truly is multifunctional. It charged it a popsocket (when placed in a certain position), an otterbox, and a leather folding phone case as well! For the price that it is, it looks quite expensive. Its so easy to use that even my 87 year old grandma is able to charge her phone by herself. Usually she has a problem telling whether her phone is charging or not but with the color change from green to blue, she loves it! I hope that the quality remains the same for a long time, I'll update this review if there are any problems.
","
First things first - it wasn’t even close to the color displayed on Amazon (see picture). It is tan as opposed to the shiny orangish gold advertised. That was a huge surprise and disappointment. Beyond that... I like it. It matches my rug exactly which is actually better than if it had been the color I thought it was. It serves my purpose perfectly. I got it to keep my AirPod charger case charged and it’s great for that. It charged my phone very slowly, but I didn’t get it for that purpose so I’m okay with that.
","
Update (8/12/2020 - was delivered 6/30/2020 ): I purchased two of these, one in black and one in white/rose gold, and although the black one works (no issues), the white/rose gold doesn’t charge my phone at all. It just sits there and blinks but does not charge my phone. I’ve even tried charging my AirPods and it still doesn’t work. Not sure if it’s just a bad one in the bunch or if the color of the charger has to do with it being defective (probably unlikely). Highly disappointed.This product is thin, lightweight, beautiful, and sleekly designed! Super easy to use (just plug in, peel off the protective sticker, and it’s ready to charge) and also offers an extended 1-year warranty (make sure to register your product). I bought two (one in white/rose gold and another in space grey) to put in my office and my bedroom - great for the price!
","
In the beginning it worked through a case. Now, you have to enter it just exactly and wait to hear your phone indicate it’s charging. And that might change when you walk away. Now, I take off the case and it’s the same, only charges when at a particular angle and sometimes have to tap it back and forth to find that angle. It charges incredibly slowly.I loved the idea of this to give the port a rest and stop dealing with wires and ports. Now, it’s still on my desk for when I’m sitting here, it can be there. But on our main area where the phone could get tapped, it is not useful.Maybe I have a lemon version, it looks very nice but I still can’t recommend it. It’s only been several weeks. I wonder when it will stop charging altogether?
","
This works really well if you don’t have a case on your phone. It will work with a case but takes a few tries to get the phone to start charging. I also had a few times where it stopped charging overnight, there’s nothing worse than having your phone 1/2 charged when starting your day. In defense of this product, the factory charger didn’t like my case either. Overall seems like a nice product
","
Easy to use
","
I find it hard to believe that I have already bought 5 of these chargers and I have not taken the time to do a review,super fast chargingsafe to usevery slim and good lookingand very durable 100% tested.I recommend it 100%
","
Awesome it looks clean
","
I usually use the wire directly  than this charging plate.  If phone moves  a little bit it won't charge. The speed of charge is good.But one day I went out in rain and my phone got wet. I dried it but still was not able to charge the mobile for 5 hours as I was getting the warning that phone is wet.But after 6 hours  I used the charging plate to charge that day. My phone Charged without any issue.Now I know when to use it.
","
I should have listened to the other reviews. I read the description carefully. I made sure it said my phone was compatible. I purchased the correct voltage power block to be able to ""fast charge"". I set my phone on it, excited to see the lights turn blue (my favorite color) and begin its speedy charge. It works, the lights are blue ... then a message pops up on my phone ""phone not compatible with fast charge, resuming at normal charging speed"". Then it shows that it'll take like 6 hours to charge my phone 70%!!!??? Whaa?! Ummm I just spent $800 on this Android phone that just came out a year ago (got it on an amazing sale 🙂). There is no reason why my phone should not be compatible! Especially when the description point blank said it was. My phone settings were set correctly and I purchased the correct charging brick. This charging pad is just worthless. I guess that's what I get for trying to be cheap. Now I'm stuck with two of these, because they are not worth the hassle of returning. Don't be like me. Spend a few more bucks and buy something that'll actually work 😕
","
Very portable, fast charging of all makes and models of appropriate phones.
","
Love the look of Tozo’s wireless chargers. The wire feels a bit weak and I fear it will start to break at the base of the charging pad after a bit of use, we shall see. The USB C/A Adapter was a bit tough to force onto the charger wire, but it clicked together and everything seems to work fine.I will be updating this after I have used the charger for a while. I am going to be taking it on the go alot and putting some wear and tear on it for sure.
","
Good enough if you’re charging overnight but not if you’re in a hurry. Takes a while to charge my iPhone 13.I probably got used to quick charging using the cable and was expecting similar results so was a bit disappointed.Good build. Looks good and the top and bottom have non-slip surfaces. Flat enough that it’s not a hassle carrying it around in a bag.
","
Been using this for over a year and it works very well. Just bought a second one.
","
It has a very thin profile, which I love it. The only thing that bothers me is the constant green light being on (it turns to blue once the phone is placed on the charger). I wished there was a way to turn it off when the phone is not being charged -- this is in my bedroom and the light bothers me a little, at night (not a big deal is the phone is being charged, as it sits over the light). Aside from that, it's a great way to save your cables and the phone port itself, as there's no plugging and unplugging cables each time you charge your cell. I might be buying another one to leave somewhere else in the house.
","
Bought this because I like the idea of a wireless charger.  It is very eye catching and it seems much more heavy duty than others I bought.  I like how it changes color to let you know that it is charging. I've only had it a couple of weeks,  So I will update if anything changes. Right now I would definitely recommend. Just bought a second for my classrooms when I substitute teach to replace a Yootech that just kept overheating and not charging.
","
I bought this wireless charger, but ended up having some issues with it charging. I have only seen great reviews for this charger, so I thought it may be defected. (This happens with varies products, so I wa not concerned.)I reached out to TOZO through FB messenger and they were very helpful. They responded in an appropriate amount of time and ultimately offered to send me a new one for free! Great customer service like this makes shopping online easier than ever!I will update my review of the product, once I receive it :)
","
However, does not like to charge through a moderately regular protective phone case. My phone won’t charge through that, sadly. However for the other two smaller items, lay them down, go, come back a short time later, and your set. The two stars off is only because I bought it  specifically for my phone
","
I bought this charger for my significant other as one of his Christmas gifts. It charges his AirPod pros perfectly! We noticed it would stop charging his iPhone 8 and we’d have to unplug it and plug it back in. I noticed the same complaint under other reviews for charging an iPhone 8 and after trying my iPhone 11 it seems it’s just not compatible with the 8 so we’re keeping it since he’ll upgrade eventually lol. Other than that it’s aesthetically pleasing for any techies. He’s happy with it. I’ll probably buy one for my dad as well.
","
The first charger I received was faulty and had problems charging…the company saw my review and reached out to me immediately! They were very apologetic and professional. I got to choose between two of the newer models of that same charger and they mailed a brand new one out to me immediately! Upon receiving the new charger it works perfectly without getting hot and the company even emailed back to check and see if it was working and if everything was ok! 10/10 I would definitely recommend this brand even if you don’t need a charger they have tons of other great products, I own a couple pairs of their wireless head phones and I LOVE them too!
","
I love that this is easy to use. I don't have to be concerned about getting a short in my charging cord, which I was regularly having to replace.I don't like that it has a bright light that stays on when it is in use. I had bought this specifically to use by my bed at night and am not able to use it in that way.I am keeping it to use in another room because if it's ease of use.
","
Even though I'm still getting familiar with it, there are still some things to learn. I think it'll be good for my next trip. For charging in the U.S., that's pretty straight forward, but you'll need a country-specific converter flr that, which is my next purchase! Thanks.
","
Got this as an Xmas gift for my wife so she can charge her phone without having to fumble with a power cable.  We both have Samsung Galaxy phones (S9 & Note 10).  This wireless charger works for both of our phones even with phone cases on.  Very happy with it and we're planning on purchasing more of these to be embedded into end tables for use by our kids and guests (trying to find a 90 degree USB C adapter since the power connector is on the side).
","
The Tozo wireless charging pad charged my phone a bit faster than other charging padsAlso other charging pads I've purchased get very hot and make the phone hot but these pads do not! Tozo is a reputable brand and does not disappoint!
","
This does NOT support fast charging. I have a Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra and I get a message saying that this is not a fast charger and will take 4 HOURS to charge my phone from 5 percent. I tried multiple power adapters that are 5v 2-3a, or 9v 2.77a, and none of them fast charge. If I plug them straight into my phone though that 4 hours turns into 1.25 hours. Do not buy if you want it to fast charge.
","
When I originally bought my phone I also bought a wireless charger it was four times the price of this one and not nearly as nice. And it did not last 2 years. The Tozo w1 charger comes with lights so you can find the charger in the dark they go from green to blue when your unit is being charged. When are you is totally charged so I change us back to green that is very helpful. It quit working after about 40 days. They will not replace after 30

 I love this charger! I was shocked to see how small it was because in my mind it was a little bit bigger. Nonetheless, I realized that it didn’t need to be bigger to charge the phone. It’s easy to travel with due to its size and it is very convenient! Above I showed that even with a a bulky case like mine, it still charges. I was afraid that it wouldn’t charge because my case is pretty bulky, but there was no problem at all with that. I recommend everyone who had a phone that is capable of wireless charging and compatible with this charger to buy it. I will update my review after I have given it some more use!
","
I love the size of this charger, and the color is great.  Couldn't beat the price on Prime Day Deals.  Love the extended warranty too!  New to wireless charger and we'll see how this one holds up!  Again, great looking, sleek, love the color, and charged quickly.  Glad that I didn't have to remove the case from my phone.  Can't wait to try other items.  Wish I had purchased a couple more for the price.
","
Worked great as long as you don’t have a case.
","
It's a place to place my phone to charge. Don't put an annoying LED light on it.
","
It was fairly easy to use. Took a minute to connect to my phone. Good for traveling.
","
I ordered this in a rush and didn't read the 'Compatibility List'. My fault.NOT compatible with my iPhone 13.
","
Like the look and thinness however not real happy that the green light is always on.  Especially at night as I like to keep one in my bedroom.  I purchased one for myself and another as a gift.  Not sure I will keep either one.  I'll check with the person who will be receiving to see if the light bothers him.  For me it's a distraction....0 star.  Might return both instead of just one!
","
Since purchasing this product there have been multiple times where I have woken up in the morning to find that my phone had not charged at all during the night. At least three times I’ve woken up to find my phone completely dead. Aesthetically it is very nice but because of this issue I have to give it three stars. I saw other reviews claiming this issue before purchasing, and I wish I had listened to them.
","
works with my iphone 12
","
Love this charger for its slim, aesthetic design and quick charging. It was a pain to plug my tozo earbuds (I have two sets), but now I can just drop them on the charging pad whenever I please!Keeps my desk clutter free, which is worth more than to me than $10 and knowing my buds are always available is a weight off my mind, since I am an on-the-go masters student who often needs to take studying to different locals.Love this little guy. My only complaint is I wish the charging lights had a “dim” mode for sleeping. But I just turn my phone sideways, so it sits across the two lights, and problem solved!
","
Just to be fair this charger is very convenience to use. But is a little bit charging slow compare to the cable charge. If my phone completely out of battery, will keep warning me charging the phone when I am changing it. One time even turn off the phone when I was using the phone at the same time charging it. If your phone has a little bit the left over battery, then charging it should works fine. Compared to the price is really okay. I am keeping it! Looks pretty good on my night stand.
","
I LIKE THE LIGHTNESS OF IT
","
Works well for my AirPods. So far so good
","
Bought this to charge tozo earbuds and a Motorola note phone.  Charges earbuds fine but does not charge the phone. The phone has a thin tpu case with some gold accents on it, perhaps there is foil in the case which does not allow the phone to charge?  Did not charge the phone face up or down so ymmv.
","
I’ve always loved the idea of wirelessly charging my phone, but as an avid popsocket user most don’t even register on my phone unless I remove the backing (which results in me promptly losing my backing and walking around with a weird lump on my phone displaying my shame for everyone to see). My husband bought one of these for himself and I tried it out, shocked to discover it charges my phone quickly even with my holder still on it! Truly a game changer!
","
I actually much prefer the TOZO W1 charger that is wider and lights up when it is charging. But this charger charges faster. It appears to work better with no case than with a case. The magnet makes sense if you want to keep it centered, but whenever you pick the phone up the charger falls off. Seems like the magnet should be stronger or have no magnet at all.Update: I contacted the manufacturer and explained the issue and they sent me a newer version that comes with the adapter. The magnet is much stronger and the adapter allows me to use a 2.4 amp USB port on the surge saver instead of an electrical outlet.
","
Got two of these for Christmas. One for the wife one for me. They are awesome. Great charging power and easy to use. I have a otter box case that’s thin and it charges. The lady has an otter box/pop socket case and it doesn’t charge with that case on. So be careful, if you have a big case it will not work unless you take it out of the case ever night. But over all I love this no cords, perfect for traveling and very sleek looking would recommend. But beware of your cases!
","
The charging lights are on both sides of the charger.  Green when it’s completely charged or no phone is on it, blue when it’s being charged.  So this is better than my last one because sometimes it would move off the pad slightly and you would wake up with zero battery.  So this feature is a positive and negative because once it’s done charging it lights up bright green at night.  So now I have a light shinning right in my face.  If you can get passed that then it’s a nice charger.
","
I purchased this hoping that it was a rapid charger.  It's not.  Charges at almost have the rate of my other chargers.
","
It’s a good product
","
I love this in theory and it works ok, but if my phone is a fraction of an inch off the center, it won’t charge. I was hoping to be able to drop my phone on this easily, but instead I have to carefully place it exactly where it likes it.
","
Looks great! This is a great cordless charger. I like the light change which tells me I got the phone placed correctly. With my fast charger attached it will charge my phone is no time.
","
purchased to take while traveling. works great fast charging in my opinion
","
It's small and works well for the price, however I find myself making multiple attempts trying to get my phone to charge on it. Once it's on there however it doesn't come off accidentally.
","
Very impressed with the look and feel of this wireless charger. In comparison to the Yootech 15W charging stand I've used before, the build quality is night and day. The charger looks as good in person as in the photos, with the glass face, silver bezel, and solid plastic back. The charging indicator is sleek and the color change when charging is nice.This charger doesn't do 15W like the Yootech but for the 10W that my Pixel 4 XL can take, the charging amperage is just as good as the Yootech as measured with an app on the phone.But really for the $13 I paid for it, the build quality is really really good and the charging speed is exactly as advertised. Would recommend.
","
This is a very attractive charger with a pleasing design, but it does have one issue for me that renders it effectively useless: the lights. They are quite bright, and unfortunately there's no way for them to turn off. This is a problem because I bought this charger for my bedroom and want it placed right next to my bed. There are some work arounds I suppose, such as putting masking tape over the lights, or positioning the phone in a very specific position to mostly cover up the lights (although if you want to check your phone over night, you get those bright lights shone directly into your eyes at 4 am), but these are all pretty inconvenient efforts for something that you don't want to have to worry about.If you want this charger for an office desk or living room, then its perfect. However, if its for a bedroom, I would stay away.

Had for two years.Works well charges my samsung s9+ and iPhone 13 pro; quickly.Quality product.(Photo of the wireless charger at night charging my earbuds.)

 I like it! Charged iPhone and todo t10 wireless headphones. Doesn’t charge Apple Watch!

The price is great, however the charger it’s self is extremely slow. Disappointed
","
I've never used a wireless charger before because I never had a reason to. But as I get more devices that support it and am running out of places to plug them in, I figured I might as well give it a shot. I was already buying a pair of TOZO's wireless earbuds so I just picked up this wireless charger too. Simply put, it works. It's heavy enough that it doesn't slide around and is super easy to use. It took longer to get the box open than it did to set it up and start using it. Now I can charge things next to my bed and not have to worry about fumbling with cables while I'm half-asleep.
","
Charges like it says but no fast charge and I did the research and got the right block amd chords for my output but I believe they may need a software update to keep up with newer phones. But lobe having it at my desk to sit down while I'm working and not have to plug and unplug while I'm on the move.
","
I like the non slip surface of this charger. I dont have to worry about small motions or my cat knocking my phone off the charging base. THere is an indicator light that turns on when charging (like most chargers do), the light on this particular model is quite small and for me hard to see. At night I think this is a nice feature as it is hardly noticeable and is no bother when sleeping, however during the day it is hard to tell that the charger is working because you have to really look for the tiny little blue light. I have only had it for a day but am so far quite pleased.
","
I really like my charger. The smooth surface is nice and its glossy appearance and lights make it nice to look at. It charges faster than my samsung surface charger. Only a couple of issues - it is small and I have to slide my iPhone 8 plus across the surface until I feel my phone vibrate indicating it is charging. It seems to have to be centered in just the right spot to charge - which is fine but it would be better if it were shaped to match my phone and / or was magnetic so that my phone just snaps into place and charges. The other issue is that because it is so smooth, my phone slides off of it if not perfectly level - this is where a magnetic charger would come in handy. Aside from that, I love it and have bought the product twice. Once for home and one that I keep on my desk at work. The price is excellent!
","
This is NOT fast charging at all, and I always charge my phone during the night- I've had this for a short time now and twice it did not charge my phone during the night, and I made sure it was charging when I fell asleep. I feel cheated out of my money which I barely have. Just go to the store and buy one
","
I bought the TOZO wireless charger because I heard that it works with charging your wireless earbuds, since I forgot to activate my extended warranty for my TOZO T10 earbuds. The charging case for the earbuds USB to Micro USB port on the house casing broke and would no longer charge. Thus, I figured I would buy the wireless charger to fix the charging issue and the wireless charger was indeed the solution to fix this issue for me.  I am satisfied that the TOZO wireless charger does indeed charge the TOZO T10earbuds! Also, please remember to activate your extended warranty for your products. Lesson learned LOL. Take care and be blessed y’all.
","
I've been using my new TOZO fast wireless charger for all of my devices that support wireless charging. I generally don't like wireless chargers, since most do not charge as fast as wired, however this fast wireless charger can charge your phone just as fast. Just plug it in to the current charger you currently use and make sure you change the cable from your AC adapter to the included in box Micro USB cable.Some reviews mention, this isn't fast wireless charging, they're wrong. They're not using the correct adapter, just look at the picture that has my Galaxy S8, says fast charging, and it charges just as fast as it would be plugged in.The design is very sleek and smooth, I love the color changing led lights, it lights green when ready, and blue while charging, it's not obtrusive at night, and can even been seen under the charging plate which I think is awesome.Overall, this is a must buy for anyone with a compatible smartphone, it's very convenient to just plop your phone on and go on about your business.
","
I bought two of these; one for home and one for the office.  My phone stays on these most of the time when not in use.  I seem to not loose the phone as often, so this is an added bonus.  Previously, I plugged and unplugged my phone several times per day, and that was annoying.  I was warned that these wireless chargers were slow to charge.  That might be the case, but I really have not noticed this.  I like this charger because due to the lights, it is easy to place the phone in the correct position.
","
I love this slim, wireless charger. I took it out of the box and used it right away! Love it for charging my wireless earbuds and my phone. Very convenient at work and home! Love it next to my bed at night too. No more worries if I plugged my phone in all the way or if the cord came out of the wall while I slept! I sometimes am on my phone at night until I’m so tired I barely can remember to plug my phone in before falling asleep. So this way, I can just set my phone on the charger and not worry that my phone will die over night!
","
Super easy to use. Just plug it in, then place your phone or earbuds on it. Never seems to take too long to charge. Never traveled with it yet, but I doubt I'd have issues tbh.
","
This is my second one.Very sleek and has a bit of weight to it.It’s easy to tell when it’s charging.The light doesn’t bother me at all in the dark.I bought one many years ago and it was a thick plastic one that falls from my night stand.Very pleased with this product.Seems fast charging but not sure. Hasn’t overheat like the other ones.

Hello.I have just recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G and I just want to affirm everyone here that the Tozo Wireless Charger works like a charm. There are definitely mixed reviews for many products but I can assure you that this product is worth the investment. This product simply gets the job done.What really caught my attention was the fact that it prevents your charging device from overheating while turning off once ur device reaches max capacity.With this in mind, it is honestly up to the customer if he/she wants to purchase this item.
","
Good for the money. Just make sure you turn off your phone or it might end up with zilch charge in the morning
","
You must place the phone in a certain direction or it covers the lights that show if its charging or finished charging. They recommend using the ( specialized ) supplied usb power cord but it's only 3feet and doesn't get from the power strip under my table to the top!  Cant they be up front about what type of usb plug the charger takes! Maybe that's good since you should only use their supplied cable. And why not be up front about the voltage and amperage they recommend for the power supply!  Why should I have to dig and scan for something that important. If you can get over that its nice looking but is a finger print magnet though I don't imagine that should be much of a problem unless you intend on carrying it around.

This purchase has been very easy to use. Just place it on the charger and it charges. I’ve been very pleased with this purchase. Easy and convenient.
","
Really easy and comfortable to use, looks slick and cool, but doesn't charge that fast (takes around x3 the time as a good cable charger). I do recommend it though, gets the job done 👍
","
If you have a new phone like me that needs one of the GOOD chargers to really work.... this is not it.  Plus I just don't like that I can't pick up my phone and use it while it still charges without unplugging this and plugging it into my phone.  Makes an extra step in my opinion.
","
Works great.  Charges overnight and doesn't overcharge.  The light turns when the phone is charging and then changes when the phone is charged.
","
This portable charger is easy to use and convenient to pack when traveling, but what I didn't like about it os that it takes quite a while for it to fully charge my phone.
","
I had planned on using it to charge my cell phone while I was at work, but it takes to long to charge my phone. First time I put my phone on the wireless charging dock my phone said 3hrs till it would be completely charged.

I have been using TOZO blutooth wireless headphones for a few weeks and they have been impressive in their build quality and sound. When the opportunity arose to get a wireless charger to charge the headphone case, it was a no- brainer. The wireless charger takes 10 seconds to install and comes with the charger and USB-C cable. The form factor is extra slim and the base of the charger has a nice mirror finish. The case is metal and provides a solid stable base to accommodate any devices that need wireless charging. Charging speed is great as well. The base has a green light and then turns to blue when charging. The USB plug was a little loose and on emailing the seller and letting them know, without hesitation they said they would send a replacement for free to and to keep the original charger. This is how all sellers should treat their customers, ensuring the customer is taken care of without question. I highly recommend this charger and also the seller. Tozo rocks!
","
This is one of the most aesthetic chargers I have ever hard! Not only is it super helpful to have the lights indicating when the phone is being charged, but it is also sleek and very light weight. I love this product so much and am definitely going to purchase more items from this innovative brand! Recently, my chargers was acting up as I had just purchased a new phone case. However, the customer service was incredible and solved my issue the same day with a few quick chats! Their customer service is very efficient and the fact that you can just chat with the company makes things so much easier! I am so happy with my product and the customer service!! 100% would purchase again!!

Just received this today.  Seems to work good. So far have tried it with iPhone X and 12 pro max and works for both. Even with a think liquid crystal fashion case on it. The iPhone 12 pro max is large and I noted you have to make sure it’s positioned in the center of the plate before the charge will connect. Didn’t seem to be that way with the iPhone X so I’m thinking it’s just because of how big the 12 pro max is. So far so good. Will update this review if I notice any concerns.I like that it’s small enough to throw in a bag when traveling. And it won’t take up much space on my night stand. Very affordable too.

This is my second wireless charger from TOZO.  The first generation of this charger was great, however this newer model seems to have more power with a slightly smaller footprint. I use it to charge my TOZO earbud base, as seen in the picture. I also use the charger to charge an Android phone with a very thick (4 credit card) case and new iPhone (one at a time, of course). It has no problem quickly charging anything that can wirelessly charge that I've tried so far.I use the included USB cable with an electrical outlet USB transformer as well as directly from my laptop USB port, depending on my needs. The wireless charger works equally well from either power source.
","
I've been real impressed with this.  The reason I even looked into this was because i bought an Otterbox Defender case to put it in.  That makes it somewhat difficult to plug in a cord.  This works perfectly.  I've had it for about a year now.  It looks good.  It has 2 circular led lights that go from green to blue when you put the phone on for a charge, and turns back to green when it's fully charged.  A pretty nice (economical) investment.
","
it's not  fast charging but it's charging slow charging
","
These work excellently.  Love the sleek thin profile, very elegant.  We have 2 of different styles, going to buy 2 more today.  Looking at the reviews, please notice how the vast majority are excellent.  The vast majority of 1 stars are for ""charges slow"" and can pretty much guarantee those are from people who used a C-to-A USB cable and plugged it into a USB 1.0 1amp charger and have no clue. If you don't put amps in it can't put amps out, end of story.  Get a good wall supply for it and these are super.
","
They work great and charge my phone and earbuds well.One small disappointement is that this pad is actually very small, so it's a bit finicky with how my phone is placed on it. If I somehow move my phone half an inch in any direction, then it will stop charging as the Qi receiver in your phone will not be lining up with the pad anymore.
","
I was looking for a high quality, inexpensive wireless charger, and I found it in this product.  It worked perfectly out of the box and does a fine job of charging my cell phone and ANC ear buds.  I have no experience with other wireless chargers, so I can't speak to its speed of charging, but it's fine for me.  I purchased one other product, ANC ear buds, from Tozo, and have found product quality to be excellent.  I highly recommend this product.
","
My charger is next to my microwave. As you can see, counter space is very limited. I set my coffee next to the charger to give an actual view of the size. I love it! The lights are green until it contacts your cellphone; then, the lights turn blue. It charges quickly and comes with its own USB cord. You need a USB plug connect for an outlet. The price of new cords was comparable to this unit, so I venture toward the 'upgrade!'
","
I'm very happy with this charger. It's thin, it's easy to find in the dark (green when not charging), and the lights change to blue when it is charging.
","
This is a very pretty and lightweight charger. I like how compact it is and how easily portable it is. What it isn’t is fast charging. I honestly can’t be that surprised as it is a $10 charger, but it does what I need it to. I keep it at work so I’m sitting next to it while it is on the charging base.
","
It’s friendly user! There are no dislikes!!
","
I have an iPhone 12 pro and my husband has the 11 and omggg this thing takes forever to charge our phones!! It says that we could purchase a different wire for a higher wattage but doesn’t specify which kind of wire or where to even get it from. Worse charging pad ever! I only purchased this because of the ratings and many reviews but I think we’re better off with a wireless charging pad from Target than this. Looks cool, that’s about it. Oh and don’t even get me started on charging my airpods! I literally need to place it on the pad and take it off three times before it starts charging like wtf.
","
I bought this to use with my new Supcase UB Pro case and it instantly starts charging the phone, no need to move around to find a spot that works.
","
These are a nice looking charger and the build quality seems to be equally as good. I've only tried it on a few cell phones, but so far it has charged quickly and efficiently. If I needed more I'd be perfectly happy buying more.
","
I like the way it looks, but my phone needs to be on it just right for the maximum amount of charging.  Sometime, even when the light turned green, it would not charge, or charge very slowly.  It seems to have a magnet to help line it up, and the phone would say charging, but it still had issues.  Not sure if it was an issue with the charger or my phone (Galaxy S9), or just wireless charging in general.
","
I like the design of this, super slim
","
On my Pixel 7, I use Power Share so that I can charge devices using my phone. I have the setting to where it won't charge any device if my battery is <35%. The past two nights I have woken up to my phone being at 35% battery. I'm forced to assume that what's happening is the charger will charge my phone until I hit 35%, then my phone will feed back into the charger in a loop non-stop, constantly keeping it at 35% battery. The charger should not support being charged so as to prevent this issue.
","
I received mine on time however, it stopped working a few days after. It won't charge anymore and the LED lights don't turn on either. I was really excited for this product as it looks and feels really high quality.
","
I really love this wireless charger. It works right through our Otter box cases of both our iPhone 8 and 10x. Charges very fast. It has a very subtle lighting that doesn’t bother me at night. I can’t stand light in my eyes while trying to sleep, and this doesn’t disappoint. It also does a great job of charging up my Tozo wireless earphones while they are in their case.Great product. Excellent price. Saves me $ by not having to replace expensive charging cables.I’m rough on my iPhone cables, and this completely solved the problem of buying expensive cables.I’m also hearing impaired and use this same company’s wireless earbuds, which charge effortlessly on this charger.Spouse has iPhone max and I have iPhone 8. They both charge extremely fast on this charger.The shipments from this company arrive very fast and include a 1 yr warranty with great benefits.Their emails are always polite, and they have great respect for the customer. This is my biggest for going back again. Thank you!
","
This is a solidly built charger with a nice clean design for the price. It is well made with a durable metal construction and has a nice rubberized charging surface. It doesn't provide a particularly fast charge but it gets the job done on a budget. I wish the cable that came with the charger blended in a bit better. A braided cable or even a black one probably wouldn't be as much of an eyesore but that is just me being picky.
","
I don’t really care for fast charging, so I use this with the iPhone charging block and it seems to charge at the same rate.This comes with a USB-C cable and does not work with a micro USB cable.The gray color is darker than the photos show, but it’s still very nice. The color is similar to Apple’s “space gray.” Even though I was expecting more of a silver gray, this still matches my desk aesthetic, which is a white/gray theme.The top is also textured to prevent your phone from sliding around. This helps if you have your phone on vibrate.There is a small singular light on the front side (not the top) of the charger indicating when it’s on standby (green) or charging (blue). It is easily covered up if the light bothers you at night.Overall, great wireless charger! I actually purchased their other wireless charger that had huge bright lights on the top of the charger and I like this one much better.
","
Slow charge and phone doesn’t fit phone.
","
Love it so much I got a second one!  Perfect for overnight charging BC it will not overcharge your phone. Also, I'm not a big fan of cords so this is great I have it on my night stand and charge my phone overnight. Before I wouldn't do that BC the wall charger would charge to 100% in about 2 hours then my phone would just be connected all night for no reason and when I woke up I would always just jerk the cord out. Now I just grab it and its usually charged to around 80% which is more than enough for me on a work day. Its also very sleek and I like how thin it is.
","
This wireless charger works relatively well for the earbuds they are designed for. It charges them at a decent pace but it heats up. As long as you don't put the charger on anything flammable or cover it you should be fine though. It also works on my iPhone and again, it heats up and charges my phone pretty slowly. For the price though, I love it.
","
My Note 9 intermittently refuses to charge normally because it says it's detecting moisture in the connection. (The thing hasn't been within two feet of any actual liquid, so it must be particularly sensitive to any non-zero relative humidity value. We've had the heat on for a month now and the air is so dry I have to discharge static before turning on my PC in the morning.)In any event, this little gizmo is happily charging my phone after its most recent recalcitrant refusal to be charged normally.
","
I really like these but despite the array of rubber tips they provide, I had to order narrower silicone ones.  Long charge time and very good sound quality.  I highly recommend these.
","
Lights up nicely and doesn't take up much space. Only downside is it doesn't do well with magnets so I have to remove my case before using which isn't a big deal personally but may be a pain for someone else
","
Looks good and does its job!
","
The second I plugged this bad boy in I felt like I was the physical manifestation of CyberPunk. I am tech. Very ""nice""!
","
The first one was defective and they sent out a new one right away. Works great, great customer service. Would have given 5 stars if not for the defective one. Would recommend.
","
I bought two, one for each beside nightstand. We've only had these for a day,  but so far so good.  I love how sleek it looks and it is so portable. I keep mistaking it for my coaster. Lol. It doesn't come with a plug so you'll need to use your own plug, but make sure it's a fast charger or it will not work as well. I have a Samsung Note 9. At 5% battery life, when I plugged the USB into a USB port on a power strip, it was 4hrs 10min to a full charge. When I plugged it into the Samsung fast charger plug, it went down to 2hr 30min.
","
It charged my headphones just fine but wouldn’t charge anything else so I find it useless.
","
This thing feels sleek, looks cool, and most importantly it charges my phone, headphones, and whatever else I decide the throw on it, now I've not tried charging two items at once but one thing at a time charges as fast as being plugged into the wall by traditional chargers. Now it's really not a penny more than buying a cable from Walmart or somewhere else so just check if your phone or whatever you want this charger for is compatible. But its a fun little way to charge your stuff 😁
","
The unit doesn't seem to hold a charge very long, but I have no other product to which I can compare it.
","
Decent product, it just charges too slowly for my liking.
","
This is my second TOZO product (just realized). I thought this would be an easy alternative to having my phone plugged in to charge but I have one of those pop-up sockets in the back - won’t go through that. I’ve charge my earphones only so far. I’d like to try something like my HD Fire if I can? Now that I got these I’m trying to think what I can use it for. The price was nice!
","
I have never tried a wireless charger before.  I knew it would work with my bluetooth earbuds, but I wasn't sure about my phone.  I have a Galaxy Note 8, and lately it's been a real challenge to any of my charging cables to work correctly.  The cable connection wears out over time, and I get tired of having to buy new chargers.Charging with this pad has revolutionized my charging at work!!!  I pop the phone out of my case, and set it on the pad.  The phone charges very quickly - and I love it!  The only trick I had to figure out was that the pad turns blue when charging and flashes green when it's asking you to get the placement right for charging.  I just move the phone along the pad until it turns blue - and it's good to go.I like this pad so much, I'm going to purchase a second pad to use at home.  So I guess that's a great review!
","
The design is very sleek and chic, but the product name is misleading. When it says wireless, I assumed you could charge it, leave it unplugged like a power bank, and recharge a phone or AirPods on the charging platform. The platform has to be plugged into the wall to work. The wireless part only means I don’t have to plug my phone into a wall. Instead I can lay my phone on a charging platform that plugs into a wall. It otherwise works perfectly fine, but I am just disappointed, since I bought this product specifically for wireless functionality.
","
Love the look, it’s nice to not have to pull and plug in a cord, however the indicator charging lights on the circle is a little bright at night when you’re trying to sleep, wish they were smaller. Also have to take credit cards out of back of phone case holder so the charge can make it to the phone. Does charge no issues with a thin otter box case but anything thicker could have a problem.
","
It looks nice. It charges your phone, as expected. Don't use it in a bedroom though.While it is true that while charging it does not emit any light, as soon as the phone is charged, the bright green ready LED comes on. In a dark room that is quite bright. So if you are sensitive to light while sleeping, this is not for you.Other than that, I like it better than the Anker wireless charger. The surface of that is that rubbery substance that attracts dust and stays dirty. So this aluminum charger is much better.
","
I absolutely love this, it's so thin and cute I have it on my desk and my coworkers think it's a fancy drink coaster. The silver and green are a nice touch and it works perfectly.
","
Bought this because my iphone connection was getting used. This is a great way to avoid repair. Much easier and faster charging,
","
Overall I like it, but there's a couple things worth knowing. First, it doesn't come with a USB wall plug, only the cord to connect the charger into a USB port. Not a huge deal if you have extras, but a bit inconvenient. The charging speed is fine, there isn't a noticeable difference from my old cord charger to this. The major drawback for me is that it's very fussy about where the phone is placed on the pad. The phone has to be sitting at the right spot or it won't charge. Nudging it a bit can make it stop charging. A couple times I woke up to a phone at less than 50% battery in the morning because of this. Double-check to make sure your phone is charging before going to bed and you should be okay.
","
Worked fine for 6 months and then just died.
","
A wireless charger makes it so much easier to charge your phone each night.. And this one is very nice indeed.. So nice, I bought another for the misses.. She too loves it.. I can't think of a stronger recommendation for a product than buying a second one..I did find one curiosity about it though.. I have powered by a multi port USB power source which has a display showing how much current a given port is drawing.. I notice once the phone is picked up off of the charger, I see the current to the charger, bounce back and forth every few seconds between zero and a few milliamps of current.. flk k
","
This pad is beautifully made, simple to use, and a wonderfully looking charging pad....i want to love it and give it 5 stars BUT it has two long lights that are CONSTANTLY lit!....can't turn them off...can't do anything about them.  Why any brand would make a permanent feature like this is absolutely beyond me as, for me, it ruins the product since I have it by my bed and it's simply too bright at night and is very annoying.  I hate that I have to buy another brand now as there is absolutely nothing wrong with this item sans that but for me, and I assume others, that's a deal breaker.  I should have read more reviews but I never even thought this would be a permanent feature on anything like this.  So buyer be warned....if constant green lights that you can't turn off are an issue for you then this is NOT what you want to buy unfortunately.
","
The W1 wireless charger works well and easy to set up. The charging power is not enough for fast charging of my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G smartphone, but it charges my phone well. The always on Green LED light does not bother me since I have the charger in my living room. When charging, the light color changes to blue so I know it is charging my phone. I am very happy with my purchase.
","
It is a very compact and convenient charger. Slim and sturdy, easy to carry. It is having a non slippery surface that makes the charging easy and convenient.
","
Easy to use by charging on my computer.  Easy to carry if needed when traveling.
","
I have 5 of these. Randomly around the house if I want to throw a device on there to charge quickly. Most devices are already NFC capable so it’s compatible with most phones. No more searching for compatible cords; no more damage to the phone from using a corded charger. Sometimes my devices get hot, so I have to check them. Once charged, don’t have to leave your device on there. I really like them for my workspace since it frees up more part of my desk. My first one has lasted me over 2 years and is still working. I like the grab and go option and not having to worry about damage to my phone.
","
Does exactly what I hoped it would do and looks pretty slick too. A bargain at twice the price.
","
I have it placed on my nightstand, everything on this is fine it’s just the LED lights on this may be a little too bright for me at night I flip it upside down most of the time when not in use.
","
Muy buen artículo, lo recomiendo
","
Everything works as expected except the fast charging capabilities which is one of the main things I purchased it for. Despite having fast wireless charging enabled on my Galaxy S20 and using the super fast charging adapter that came with the phone, my phone says the fast charging is not compatible (despite being able to fast charge on the wireless car charger).
","
I have had my eyes on wireless chargers for a while now, & after reading the reviews & seeing how cheap it was I decided to get it. It has a sleek design, & I like that it is small. Only downside is although it does charge my phone, it's not as fast as my wire charger. Still happy I bought it though!
","
Wireless charging is a dream yet to be fulfilled - at least for this device.The trick is to find the 'sweet spot' - the phone has to be placed just-so for the charge to be most efficient. It has lights to assist with that: green for stand-by, blue when the phone is 'charging'. But even when the blue light has been on all night, the phone will have typically will hold only a fraction of its capacity (although I have managed to find that sweet spot a few times to get a 100% charge).It would be a mistake to think that this has any more power than any other charger. It all depends on the wall plug that you connect it to (not included). Mine is 40 Watts, which will charge my phone via cable in 30 minutes. As far as I can tell this device only pulls 15 Watts so that even when you have a good wireless connection it takes a loooong time to charge. They all work the same way.To be honest, I've had this problem with every wireless charger I've ever had so it's not unique to this device. But it looks sharp - it's thin and shiny but it just doesn't work very well.
","
Works perfectly
","
Product works but very slow to charge. My guess could be because on the iPhone 13 pro it won’t sit flush due to the camera lenses. Would I buy it again? Nope , at least not for and iPhone charger
","
Beats the hassle of always plugging in.
","
I use it in my office to charge my iPhone 8 and the AirPods. Both units are in the protective cases. I have never tried to see how quickly it is charging - no need. It does the job as far as I see.I don't think it is convenient to use it on the road unless you are several days in the hotel.

 We bought the white Tozo wireless charging pad and we love it! It is so easy to use. Simply place your device on top of it...and it is charging! The lights turn green before you place anything on it (meaning ""ready to charge"") and they turn blue once you set something on it and is charging. It charges really fast, and is so convenient for traveling! We love all of our Tozo brand electronics!! We use this to charge our Tozo NC9 Wireless [Active Noise Cancelling] ear buds [which we 100% LOVE]! The earbuds deliver Bose quality audio when listening to music! We highly recommend.
","
Sleek and unobtrusive, neat looking, small, and get the job done.  There are lights that look cool until you want to sleep and the reason you bought the chargers is for bedside.  Now at night there is a glow from my wife's side of the bed and from her desk across the room.  Perhaps I can tape them over but they curve around the side of charger and I'm worried about heat. The cord is also short at 3', but that's what was advertised and I guess it's pretty standard.
","
I loved everything about this but it would not work with my iPhone 12. Customer service was outstanding and sent me a replacement which came in 2 days. I am assuming at this point it is the color of my phone which is rose gold with a silver apple on the back which inhibits charging. A friend stopped by with a Droid and it worked perfectly. Loved the company, look and product. Highly recommend even though it did not work for me!Turns out it’s my 1 month old iPhone 12. Apparently there’s an issue with the magnets around the wireless charging inside the phone. Apple says I’ll be getting a new phone.
","
We use leather wallet covers on our iPhones.  The chargers worked with covers on if we wiggled them around on the pad till we saw the charging icon on the phone. Worked better when we took covers off.  It’s really too big an item for travel, as the regular charger is much skinnier.  It, it helps in a pinch.
","
This is a beautiful piece of tech. It's the nicest looking thing on my table, that's for sure. Mine came with a USB-C connection, which was perfect. Charges everything I have put on it so far - Pixel 3, Samsung earbuds, Fire tablet, even my old Windows phone (I've held on to it. Call me sentimental.) The included cable is on the short side - only about 39 inches, but I had other cables I could use. The only other consideration is that it is always lit up, though it is is not overly bright. This is fine, even attractive, in my home office, but could be annoying if you were planning to put it bedside.
","
Bought wireless charger to eliminate wires, works great!
","
It charges well. I have not traveled with it yet, but I’m going to assume that it travels well. It’s lightweight enough. Easy to use.

I needed a charger for my Sony Wireless Earbuds.  So I decided to pick one of these up they work great and I can charge anything else wirelessly that will sit ontop as well.  Great Price and Very Well Built like a slab of metal.
","
Really happy with this charger. It's a super sleek design and charges just as good as the Yootech ones that I have. And the price is competitive.
","
It's seems like a small thing: chuck your phone onto a flat disk to charge versus plugging it in, but it actually is super convenient. I keep mine by my desk and whenever I sit down, I just take my phone out of my pocket which isn't all that comfortable when sitting anyway, and just place it on the charging disk. It always starts charging instantly. In contrast, with each of the different model iPhones I 've owned previously, I would gradually get a lint build up in the charging port that was very hard to clean out and made charging harder and harder over time. That's no longer an issue.
","
Received this item on time !Doesn't come with a box so it can be used as a wall charger. Claims to be a fast charger but it definitely is not! I have a Galaxy 10+ and it takes hours from 60% to charge to 100%, while having it connected to my computer.
","
I like the way the lights change from green to blue when your device is charging and back to green when you have a full charge.  However, it’s a little bright.  At night in a dark room, it’s a bit much.  It would be nice if it were just more dim.  It stands out in the dark.  If lights in your dark room don’t bother you when you’re trying to sleep though, it’s no biggie.
","
I bought two of these wireless charging plates (one black and one white). The white one has two semi-circle LEDs that light up on the top of the plate indicating that it's charging. The black one has a small LED on the front side of it that is the charging indicator. The phones I charge on the plates did not come with a wireless charging capability - I added an adapter that plugs into the USB-C port and is sandwiched between the phone and the phone cover.  The combination works great. So much easier than constantly having to plug and unplug a cord. I will be buying more of these to have in different parts of my home.
","
I have six or so wireless chargers spread around the house. I got this one to put on a flat spot in my truck. I figured I could just place my phone on it while traveling and it would keep the phone charged. Well I soon brought it back in the house. Here is what it has that my others do not. FEEDBACK. First I know it is plugged in because there two green lights on all the time. Unfortunately I have placed my phone on a wireless charger that was not connected in, in the past. Second when the phone is on the charger and charging, the light turn blue, so  you know it is working. I also like that it is very thin. And yes it charges with my thick phone case.
","
I bought this charging pad for my Google pixel 5. It arrived with several small scuffs, but I imagine it will end up slightly scratched with regular use anyway. Upon first using it, I immediately noticed that it's quite sensitive and my phone needs to be placed directly in the middle, and won't charge if it's off-center at all. However, it's easy to tell when it's connected because the light is green when the pad is plugged in but changes to blue when charging the phone. Charging power seems a little slow, because my phone estimates 3 hours to go from 60% up to a full charge, I'm not sure whether that's a fault of the product or something to do with my phone, but I mostly charge my phone while I sleep so I don't mind if it takes a few hours.Overall, good quality for such a cheap price. And it saved me around $50 instead of buying Google's wireless charging stand.

 I just ordered this TOZO wireless charger it works as expected I love the feel to it, it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, the lights are great it let's you know if you placed your device correctly in the center(as the video shows the light changes color). As you can see it does come in different  colors I love this metalic blue. No I don't have to worry if I tug on the phone charger I can just grab it and go, the size is perfect for traveling you can put in your carry. I definitely give it a 5 stars.
","
No complaints. Works exactly as it should. I use a Spigen case and it has no issues catching.
","
It charges an iPhone8 in a Smartish Wallet Slayer (v1) that contains a driver's license, credit card, and a contactless building-access card. It isn't too picky about the position of the phone, although unfortunately if I position the touch ID over the charger so that I can unlock the phone without it rocking, that is too off-centered to charge. The light makes it easy to tell if it is charging (blue if charging, green if not). The light is faint enough that it isn't annoying. It is plugged directly into a USB port on a power strip that supplies 2.1A max.

I actually ended up buying this because I saw on Reddit that it can charge a puffco peak pro and that’s what really appealed to me. I have it in the kitchen so it’s great bc everyone that visits uses it if they need a charger, my only complaint though is it is a little slow on charging but it gets the job done!
","
I got one for my nightstand and one for my husbands. Both charge our iPhones well. I had to remove my pop socket in order for it to charge my iPhone 10XS max (wouldn’t charge face down on charger). I was hopeful that it would charge some of our other devices, but am disappointed that it doesn’t charge any of the following (Bose wireless headphones, two different types of external battery chargers, iPad, Apple Watch). May send back if I can find something similar that does charge other items.
","
I finally decided to purchase a wireless charger for my iPhone when I found this charger I never liked the look of other chargers they all seemed to bulky and didn’t think they would look good on my table but this thing looks nice and is very compact and has nice light indicators letting you know when it’s charging. I ended up getting one for my bedside table and a second one for my desk at work and have received multiple compliments on it.I use a thin case on my phone and have had zero issues with this charger and a coworker who has a otter box case works as well and he mentioned his wireless charger he has to take his phone out of his case and he ordered one of these right away!
","
Smaller than I thought it would be, But it works no problems.Very nice 10/10Would still buy again.
","
I admit I wasn’t sure it would work as I have an iPhone 8 Plus. It works great! I only wish it came with a regular wall plug as well as many hotels don’t have the proper plug.
","
Great product, absolutely no issues.
","
The design is sleek which is about where the pros stop for me. This thing takes forever to charge. Like 4+ hours to get a full battery. The light stays on the whole time and it’s bright. You can position the phone just right though to cover the lights and it helps a bit. It’s also a little annoying to get it in the right spot, since the iPhone 14’s camera doesn’t allow the phone to lay flat it’s a bit hassle to get the charger contacted right.
","
Love how convenient this wireless charger is!  I keep it on the end table next to my recliner, rotating my 2 sets of wireless earbuds, they are always charged and ready for use. I also place my phone on it for a quick charge if need be.  My earbuds are used every evening while my honey watches TV and I'm surfing or watching something on my laptop.  Shipping was great, packaging great and extremely happy with the looks of the charger.
","
only had it briefly, and got it for the TOZO T12 earbuds, but, it worked without a hitchlooks and feels like ""quality"", nicer than expected.all i did was plop the earbuds charger gas down on this, and voila.. it was charging.never had a wireless charger before, but, this one looks great, is a large size ( as in, larger wireless devices will rest on this easily , its not cumbersome ), has a great fit and finish.really, just a very nice charging device..will update in the future if this changes negatively.
","
The charging coil is a little small which makes placement of your phone a little difficult but it works well and looks goodUpdate 1/22/2022 - device stopped working - sent a support request through the manufacture's website.
","
This unit works very well. It fast charges my Galaxy S7 quickly. It's just as fast as the charger that came with the phone. The secret to this unit is, get a version 3 usb power block to energize it !! If you want full output it is crucial you use version 3. Version 3 power blocks provide more energy than the older power blocks. Just sit your device to be charged between the green leds and your device will begin charging. The charger leds are blue while it charges. It's a good unit but you need to use version 3.
","
We have bought 4 of these and they all work great.  No more plug in and unplugging the phone!!  I don't have the higher rated chargers so is charging slower, but I think this may be a good thing.
","
Lays flat, charges well. Easy to use and great for travel as it takes up little to no room to pack.
","
Charges my phone right quick
","
I absolutely love this charger! First let me start off by saying this wireless charger charges just as fast as the oem does. I highly recommend anyone that’s on the fence about buying it to go ahead and get it! It’s definitely worth it! It’s nice to just lay your phone on top and not have to deal with trying to plug in your phone in the middle of the night. I found its really easy and has a great charging area. I usually just use the green led strips to guide me where to place the phone in the middle of the night. It doesn’t come with a wall adapter so make sure you get the correct plug for it! Anyone else saying it charges slow is most likely using the wrong usb wall plug. Just make sure it’s a quick charge (I got a 3.0 but I’m sure the 2.0 works as well)
","
This charger is easy to use and it takes up minimal room. I love that it stops charging when the battery is fully powered. I love that I can charge it with my case on my phone. The only issue is that I have a pop socket and when I tried to charge the phone face down it didn't work, which forces me to take the case off. Otherwise, I definitely would recommend especially to those with no pop socket.
","
Does it charge? Yes.Is it legit? Probably not. The packaging clearly shows a totally different selection of colors, none of which resemble what I ordered. The back is a nice muted metallic gold, while the front is an ugly beige rubber thing. According to the instructions, led (indicator) lights are supposed to light up and show ""charging status"". The beige rubber has no led lights at all, i doubt it even has the capability to light up at all so it's not a defect, which leads me to believe this product must be some kind of knock off.It's nice for what it is, but when comparing it to another wireless charger I bought on Prime day for the same price, I'd rather keep the other one.
","
2 of the 3 work well.  One charges much slower and gets the phone hot.  Oddly its the one that always displays Fast Wireless Charging on the phone but is actually charging slower than the others ?All run off QC 3.0 power supplies
","
This charger is working great with my iPhone.
","
The first few days I had my charger it worked fantastic! After about a week I noticed that sometimes it would stop charging in the middle of the night. I contacted customer support and they advise that they would send a new one free of charge.I will I update my review once I get the new one and have a chance to review it.
","
I bought the TOZO W1 Wireless Charger so I can have a charger on my desk that doesn't take up to much room. I chose this charger because of the great price so I was not expecting much. I was amazed about how well made they made this product. This really thin charger is sleek, beautiful and elegant and it has a professional build quality to it.
","
The sleek, black, flat look and charging power is what gets this wireless charger four stars. My only complaint is that when it is not in use at night, the lights on the charger are VERY bright and are a bother when trying to sleep. My solution is to turn it over when not in use. I wish I could give another half star.
","
Me agrada, sobre todo, lo liviano, antideslizante y fácil de utilizar...
","
It works for me even through the case however does not charge through a pop socket so you end up just taking your case off constantly and just kinda annoying.
","
This is a very sleek looking charger. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max with a case on it. I had to remove my PopSocket because your phone must sit flush to the charger to use this. I also have to set my phone in a specific location on the charger for it to register, which may be due sheerly to my phone's size. It takes quite a bit of time for my phone to charge this way. That said, it does work.
","
I’m surprised I like using this charging plate so much. I don’t feel comfortable traveling with it because it seems like it would break unless packed well. Is it needed? Absolutely not; total waste of money. Fun and easy to use? Yes! Thought about returning but it’s pretty darn cool to use.
","
Love the look, it’s sleek and slim. Perfect size for bedside table. I used it every night since purchasing. I’m about 10 months in but now it has stopped charging. I place my phone on it and it will be blue (which indicates charging) for about 30 seconds and then start blinking green…Not sure why it doesn’t work anymore..
","
**UPDATE** this charger works great. When I first placed my iphone X on this charger, it kept dinging. You know the ding when the cable is bad or the connectionis loose. I tried a new cable and the same dinging.  **the outlet adapter was bad** After using new outlet adapter, charger works great.  It’s true that the light may be a distraction at night. But it is easy to cover it.
","
This charger is great....when it works. Half the time I try to use it, it flashes green indicating the phone or AirPods aren't charging. When it works, its great and charges quickly. It has a sleek design and is visually appealing. However it sometimes doesn't charge or will indicate that it's charging but not be (charged phone overnight and it was only at 16% battery in the morning despite charger saying it was charging all night).
","
I use mine with a Samsung S8 and to charge my TOZO earbuds. So far they work great an I like that the charging pad is small instead of 3-4 inches round like the samsung ones.  The reason I didn't give 5 starts is that the cost of being a smaller pad is that you have to have it perfectly lined up on the center of the phone for the charging to work.  All in All is a good buy for the money.
","
This wireless charger does exactly what it is supposed to do. I was able to charge my iPhone 11 through the case which has been a problem in the past with similar chargers. I was also able to charge wireless earbuds and an Amazon reading device. If you’re looking for a solid product the won’t tray you wrong then go no further. Is give it 5 stars if it did something truly different and amazing, but it is definitely the best of those I’ve tried! Thank you Tozo!
","
Just plug it in and said something on it if it's wireless charge capable this pad will charge it I love it it's great
","
It's so sleek! I love the cnc'd metal body and how it looks on my desk. It's very unobtrusive, it's lightweight, and works very well so far. I purchased it to replace a wireless charger with a ""keys sensing"" function to turn off the charger if you accidentally set something on it other than your phone, but it constantly turned off when my phone was on it unless I took my case off. This TOZO charger works great with my case on. I also have one of those removable popwallets that snaps onto a plastic base stuck to my phone case, so I end up with my case + an extra plastic piece when I want to charge my phone, and it still charges great with no issues. I'm very satisfied overall.
","
Great product especially for the price. You can tell it's built to last, it's not made from cheap plastic like so many are. Definitely reccomend. One negative on certain ones, my wife has the grey and it's charging light is small and not super bright at night. Mine however is the one with lights on top, really is bright so I have to position my phone a certain way to cover the light. My own fault for not listening to the smart one (wife) and no star reduction because they have lots of options with the small light. Not huge deal for some but I wake up easy to light so ya. Will buy again for sure, if it breaks.
","
Easy to place your phone as it seems it has a decent range and thus, you don't need to be too precise about putting your phone on the center. Quick charges my phone but I think it might depend on the phone's capability for fast charge as well. No complaints thus far and I've had it for about 6-months so I'm thinking about buying another one. Overall 4.8 Star rating!

 I have used wireless chargers is the past, the expensive ones and all i have to say is that they can be too heavy and inconvenient at times. This charger is now my favorite charger, everyone in my family has an iPhone and can now simply place our phones with no problems!  The best thing i love about this product is that it is not flat in the bottom but rather had some silicon support so that it won't slip or fall, it is stuck to the surface until someone lifts it. affordable and very good looking to buy multiple and place them around your home! Very good gifts as well for the upcoming holidays! 100 percent satisfaction guaranteed!
","
This charges pretty good, and is nice to just rest your phone on during work. It can charge through many cases, but not extremely thick ones.For example the case I frequent is a wallet case, When I have my cards and money in it and keep the case open (it has a flap) the case becomes too thick to charge.

 This stopped working after a few months. The light just flickers green sometimes and most of the time when I put my phone on it, it doesn't charge and the light doesn't turn blue (to show it is charging). Nice while it lasted I guess. Too late to return it
","
Note, does not come with a power supply.  I connected to one I had and this works great with my thick heavy-duty iphone 11 case.  Other chargers would not work with this phone and case, so that's great.The only think to note is the lights do not go off and are moderately bright.  They are great to find the charger in a dark room or bedside, but some may find them a bit bright.  For me, has not been a problem, but something to note.Build quality seems very good and I am pleased with this purchase.UPDATE unit started making a slight pulsing buzz sound. Contacted seller and they are sending a replacement. Very pleased they stand behind it.
","
Initially, this worked fine out of the box, slow but fine for over night charging.  Now it starts to charge but within seconds flashes green and stops charging.  Phone case is the same as it was when initially using this device. Sadly, 3 months later, it’s just a waste of money.
","
I still need to try this with a slighty thicker case, but my s22 w/case and full pop socket (base + top) charges great! Normal charge most of the time but putting the USB cable into my phone's power brick often allows fast charging! Would recommend, may buy a 2nd for my living room! Also love all the color options!
","
I used it right next to my bed. This charges my iPhone but reaalllly slooww. Sometimes the charge cycle won’t complete even in 6 hours. On top of it this has a loud hum when not charging anything. Looks nice and glossy though!

 I ordered silver and it is actually white with a silver rim. It is about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and the cord is about 3‘2“ long. No AC adapter is included.My iPhone 8 successfully charged while it was in its cellphone case, although I had to remove my credit card, $20 bill and driver’s license from the pouch on the back of my case. My Apple watch did not charge on this.When it is plugged in there’s a green LED light showing that it is ready. When you put something on it that it doesn’t recognize, the green light will blink and when you put something on it that can be charged, the green light will turn blue.
","
It looks good and charges the phone, but the LED in it is obnoxiously bright. I put 4 laters of duct tape on it and it's still fairly bright at night.Also, my phone changes charging speed based on when I change it (charging slowly at night), but it never works with this charger for some reason. It works with my wife's, so I don't get it.
","
This is by far the best wireless charger I've ever used. I'm amazed it can fast charge through a thick case, I'm sold.. Thanks TOZO..
","
It does what it's meant to and charges my phone. I wouldn't say it's a fast wireless charger, it charges about 1% for every minute or so. It has 2 LED lights that DO NOT turn off, keep that in mind when you're planning in having these in dark bedrooms. It also requires your phone to be in an exact position to charge, otherwise it simply won't. I've had morning where I thought I placed it charging but it was askew and didn't charge at all.
","
Love this charger! Can use it on multiple electronic devices!! It does take a little longer to charge....but that is fine with my needs.
","
I was originally looking at this for my earbuds and saw that it would charge my iPhone as well, so that sold me.  I use it more for my phone than anything else.  My only complaint would actually be my husband's complaint:  He has a case that has a battery pack on it so it doesn't charge his phone unless he removes the case.  Otherwise all good!
","
With me every night!  Phone is always ready for a full day every morning.  You can’t go wrong with this charger!
","
They hold a charge for hours and hours.  I fall asleep and when I wake they are still playing.  Very comfortable.
","
Great product for the price. No nonsense set up/plug and use. I like the slim, inconspicuous design. Highly recommended.
","
I can’t believe for this price it works so well!  I have a thick phone case on my iPhone and many other chargers that I’ve tried won’t work with it, but this does and charges super fast!
","
Wow, this thing is so thin! It's gorgeous. I love the white and gold color.It's super easy to use, you just plug it in to any USB-C cable and wall adapter. It comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable but you can use any cable you have laying around. I appreciate that it's not micro-USB because I got rid of all my micro-USB cables a while ago.The lights are green when it's ready for charging and blue when it's charging something. I haven't slept with it yet but I'm hoping it won't be too bright for sleeping.For the price and shipping speed I am really satisfied.
","
Doesn’t come with chord but works weel
","
Very d so low to charge my phone but pretty!
","
Okay, first off, this wireless charger looks so slick in black!! Love how it looks. The magnet strength is great. The cable has a Velcro strap attached to it— something not many companies include…Nice little touch. Also, with companies like Apple transitioning from USB charging cubes to USB-C charging cubes, it’s nice that Tozo included an adapter so you can use this wireless charger with either. It charges devices quick. For the quality, the lower price, as well as the little touches they’ve included that other companies don’t include— I think it was money well spent and definitely recommend!
","
This is my favorite charger. It even stops charging my items once the charge is full
","
The charger appears to be built well with sturdy materials. The silver edging and white faces options matches my iPhone well. The charging lights on the side are very useful and actually visible when conspired to other products. However, the lights never turn off even if no device is sitting on the charger if that would be an issue for anyone. It charges through my phone case, is quite thin, and fits in a pocket in my briefcase if I need to carry it around. Overall, this is a great product. I have 5 stars to everything except for 4 stars in the charging field only because I have not yet tried out the fast charging with a third party fast charging adapter yet. The charger only came with a 3-4 feet charging cable and not a charger. In the future I would like to see the option to bundles purchase with the fast charging adaptor and possible longer charging cables.
","
Really good charger. Good for light sleepers as the light goes out when charging. Phone is always charged when I leave in the morning
","
My grandchildren are happy
","
Loving this charger so far! I couldn’t find one anywhere that I thought would actually look good, until I came across this. I opted for the matte version because the charging light is much more subtle than on the other version. The matte finish also helps to keep my phone in place, and the charger itself stays in place pretty well too. Being able to just set my phone down now when I go to sleep is so much more convenient than having to rummage around for a cord. And the charger is super thin (even thinner than expected) so it doesn’t take up much visual space, which is great!
","
After my Apple charger broke I needed another charger for my iPhone 11 and I thought why not try out a wireless charger? I searched through many chargers and this was the one that caught my eye. The design on this charger is gorgeous, I love how slim and sleek it is and the different colored LED lights that indict charging/not charging is brilliant. Only reason I deducted a star was because it doesn't charge as fast as I would like, takes about 30 minutes to reach 50%, but that could just be my phone. Overall a great charger at a great price.
","
Love it, charges my I phone no problem. Easy to use, put phone on and ofc it charges - color change from green to blue then back to green let’s me know exactly when it’s charging or fully charged, easy peasy 😁
","
This is the second wireless charger that I tried.  Works well.  Unit has two small lights that remain on when plugged in (wish they would turn off after 30 seconds).  Light changes color when phone completely charged which is nice feature.
","
I like how small it is and how well it works with my phone and earbuds.
","
Easy to use, very slim, and blends seamlessly with my nightstand. My only complaint is the charging speed, which isn't necessarily their fault. In my experience, all wireless charging is much slower than wired charging. Also the lights are a little bright while I'm trying to sleep. I usually just flip over my phone and the charging pad on top of it so they don't keep me awake.
","
Have a bunch of these things al over my home and at work. This particular one is the first one that I can say works fantastic. I can fully charge my iPhone 12Pro on it in 2 hours tops. My previous one would maybe do half a charge in the same time using the same power supply. I’m pretty sure the charging “circle” on this one is larger as well. I don’t have to precisely place my phone on it to have it work.
","
This is the first wireless charger I've had , and it's everything I expected.  It's light weight, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to use.  It's easy to tell if it's plugged in, and when the phone is charging by checking the built in LED light.  It appears to charge at a good pace.  I haven't dropped it, or spilled any liquid on it, so I can't say how sensitive it is to those things, but I would think it fairs similar as other brandssince it seems like solid construction.  It also has 4 attached little rubber feet that keep it level, stable, and from slipping around.  I recommend it, and would get it again.
","
It is nice, very slim and convenient. It won’t charge something that doesn’t have wireless charging capabilities so no need to worry about things getting set on it. ** if you want to charge quickly, you have to have(buy) a quick charge adapter. Luckily I already had one, otherwise it seems slower than a regular charger. But I’m very happy with my purchase.
","
My iphone does not charge with the case on. I have a card holder on the case too…not sure if thats why. So that’s annoying…but still may keep it
","
I have a magnet on the back of my phone to put in my car for a hands free holder. This product will not work when you have a magnet on your phone. I checked it with my son’s  phone and it works fine but he doesn’t need it and now I can’t use it because I love my hands-free car holder
","
First product didn’t charge my phone even though color changed to blue, I received a second as a replacement and works great so far. No complaints for the price and great customer service. Great for charging on flat surfaces and carrying on the go, but limiting if you don’t have a flat surface available to balance your phone on
","
It’s nice and thin. Easy to use. But it has the phone screen light up all night and that results in a bright glow  Can be disruptive to sleeping

 I own 2 Tozo wireless earbuds and an iphone that has wireless charging ability.  I already have a Tozo W1 wireless charger and bought this one to have multiple chargers. This one is sleek, thin, and my kids love using it.  The one difference between the W1 and W3 that I’ve noticed is that with the W1 the green lights on the face turn blue to indicate your device is charging.  For the W3, the green light on the side of the charge will change from a solid green to blinking green when it is charging.  For a Dad with teenage kids this charger is a hit because it is “cool” for charging phones and their wireless earbuds.
","
Does exactly what it’s advertised to do. Quickly charges a multitude of devices
","
This product is Awesome! First wireless chargers I’ve purchased. Great packaging, no imperfections, absolutely Beautiful design. It’s literally like having a coaster on your night stand, takes up next to no room at all. Once the wireless charger is plugged into the wall, the green lights will turn on, place your Qi enabled device on top and the lights will turn blue indicating that it’s charging.(center your device of course, it’s a small circle, very easy. Don’t let it hang of the edge because that just makes no sense)Shipment came in quickly and there’s even a 1yr warranty with the product (QR code in box to scan) once you register for your warranty you will receive a kind email from the company.Enjoy this product. Wireless charging simply makes my day easier. I don’t have to take the time to plug in my phone. Now i just set my phone down and make sure it’s on the charging disc. Super simple :)
","
In researching around for a charging pad for my iPhone XS Max and my bf’s 11, I came across this one and the 4.5/5 3200+ reviews caught my attention. This charger is very nice and thin profiled. I like the white/gold combo, which goes nicely with the white Apple iPad adapters that we use to charge all of our electronics (note: this does NOT come with a wall adapter). Not only does this charge quickly (7.5w), but what really won me over is that it’s able to charge my phone WITH my popsocket on! I was afraid I’d have to take it off every time I needed to charge my phone, but nope! A lot of the ones here on amazon state that they are unable to charge your phone with a metal case, a popsocket, etc. No worries with this one :) Bought two already. Totally worth it.
","
This is probably my 3rd TOZO product, and as with the other 2 products, I'm really impressed with this W6 charger regarding quality and aesthetics. It charges my Galaxy earbuds, and my wife's Apple airpods plus, from low to full capacity in very good time. I also use it to charge my Note20 Ultra. The result is impressive.  Truth be told, if you don't have a USB C wall adapter lying around somewhere in the house, you might have to buy one in order to use the W6 charger. This is a very good and dependable product that I will recommend to anyone looking for a wireless charger, especially one with a small footprint.
","
No matter what I tried I could not get this charger to charge any phone unless It was situated perfectly, and even then the charging would loose connection and stop charging. Several times I would wake up in the morning to my phone being completely dead rather than charged. The unit does feel well build and looks nice though.
","
Like the thin profile, light weight.
","
I use with my Iphone 11 Pro Max. No problems yet. Works as expected! Admittedly, I don't have testers like others for actual speed of charge, etc - but phone indicates it's fast charging.I have a 2 types of Specks cover (plastic & rubber) for my phone & tried it & no interference at all.Generally, I like Tozo products like my wireless earbuds (and their pricing & cust service), which is why I went with this one, and so far this charger keeps that expectation met & Great value of course. I already registered my warranty and its all set!
","
Such a cute charger!! Love the sleekness and the convenience but it takes foreverrrrrr to charge my phone. The lights on mine are green and you need to make sure that you position your phone right in the middle and the blue light will indicate that your phone is charging.... but it still takes forever for your phone to charge. It might be because I have it placed on my desk and I'm tempted to pick it up every time I receive a message (taking it off the charger) instead go having it on a cord which you can check a message while it's still plugged in. You can still look at your messages while it charges but the moment you pick up your phone out of habit to answer, it will stop the charging (obviously but I didn't realize how many times I would be interrupting my charging).
","
I use this mostly for overnight charging, by using the USB A adapter and plugging it in to my powered nightstand. It clings very well to my iPhone 13 pro. But that part is influenced by the phone case you may have. It’s less expensive than the apple version, and works perfectly for me.
","
I purchased the product to remove the inconvenience of plugging a charging cable every time I need to charge my iPhone. The product's design has a premium feel, and it works as it is described in the product description. By the way, when you purchase the product, please check the design. The one with a glossy panel has nice LED indicators on the surface, whereas the matte finish has a small LED on the product's rim. It is not the first time purchasing a TOZO product. NC9 earbuds were the first one, and I am very satisfied with the performance of the product. If you are looking for a wireless charger, I highly recommend buying it.
","
** Update: I was able to contact customer service and they were super fast and great with replacing the charger.Loved it for the time it worked but now randomly will turn off in the middle of the night leaving my phone dead when I wake up. Bought it in November so I have had it for less than a year.
","
Little power to charge, takes longer to charge my cel phone
","
Got this in a pack for my earbuds. Charges anything that can be charged wirelessly. Charges fast and gives off a green light when it is charging
","
I bought 3.  The reason I gave it 4 stars because the seller shipped an opened box with wrong charging cable.  The other 2 are good.  The product is great.  Very well design.  I like the light, it changes color when the phone is fully charged.  When not charging, it is green, and when charging it is blue.  In general, it would take ~30 mins to charge 10%.  I use the iPad adapter, the product doesn’t come with power adapter.
","
Really enjoy the wear and tear it saves on connectors
","
I purchased two TOZO Wireless Chargers and both are working great on both my wife's iPhone 8+ and my iPhone X.  They also look sharp which is a real plus if you worry about setting something out in your house where guests might see it.  BTW:  I really like the surface status light that switches from green to blue once you place a phone on the surface and it starts charging.  There is a manual, but the wireless charger is for the most part plug & play - really straight forward.  The website clearly identifies that there is no AC Adapter provided with the purchase, but if you're like me you have a bunch of these sitting around your house - if not, they are cheap.BTW:  One thing that really surprised me was the included 1 Yr warranty registration card that was included...  I really wasn't expecting that for a product that cost under $20.
","
This wireless charger does it's job for half the price of the other ones. I don't need fast charging but I don't think this does that. It works on all devices that have wireless charging and is very cute so I don't mind having it on my table!

Update:  Sophia from Tozo customer service reached out to me.  She advised that my device is out of warranty but because they take care of their clients and want us to be happy, she offerred to reimburse me for the cost of a new unit purchased via Amazon.  Hence why I changed my rating to 5 stars.DO NOT BUY FROM TOZO, their warranty & customer service is less than poor.After just over 1 year my charger stopped working four to a loose connection.I submitted a warranty claim via their website and sent various emails but they never replied.I contacted Amazon and was told that there’s nothing they can do, too bad!

Makes charging your phone easy and convenient. Been using this magsafe iphone charger for 2 weeks now and It charges your phone fast. Less than 30 mins, expect your phone to be fully charged ( depending on how drained your battery).This charger is  simple to use, Just put your phone on top of the slim and decent sized charging plate. The power cable comes attached to the charging plate for easy storage. Would  definitely recommend this item.
","
Love it
","
The first one worked so I bought two more so I had one at work as well.Of course these don't charge as fast as plugging the phone in, but it does charge and it's nice just to lay my phone on it and charge.I'm almost always streaming youtube etc so I am pretty hard on my phones. So if it works for me it may charge even faster for those of you who just leave your phone on it and walk away without leaving the screen on for video like I do.
","
I bought this for my husband so he could have a quick charger at his desk, it’s super helpful and charges quickly! It turns on a feature that makes his phone make a bunch of extra sounds (clicks when he uses his regular charger, the silence button makes a super loud beep when he turns it on, etc), we figure this might just be some fine tuning to figure out but it’s so helpful and I’ll be picking one up for myself soon!
","
I got this for my desk army work. Super pretty and perfectly fine for charging by setting my phone on it. I’m not looking for anything super fast, so I haven’t paid attention to that.I got the rose gold and it’s a perfectly lovely shade of pink. Not sure what anyone was expecting…
","
I haven't had a need to do any traveling and away from home charging yet.  It lights up blue when charging and turns to green when no longer charging.  I charge at night when going to bed.  It took a couple times to get the right position for a charge with my phone.  I know I've got it right when my phone chimes and the charging pad light goes from green to blue.  At a full charge, it seems to know when to stop charging because I'll see the lights on the pad go back to green.
","
Looks cute and even charged through my bulky phone case
","
I wanted music for my exercise time.  These are superb sound quality, Bluetooth audio from my phone - just pick a playlist.  Waterproof - I use them exercising in the indoor pool (just not when swimming laps- ears have to stay above water).  I popped them in on the treadmill at the gym and 45 minutes flew by.  I set my pace by my music choices and really enjoyed being in “my happy place”.  Have gotten over 10 hours of use from first charge.

This is my first time purchasing a wireless charger and it works like a DREAM. I’ve had it for few days and ever since then I haven’t touch my Apple Wall Charger. The price was great. I honestly did not expected much but for my surprise Tozo wireless charger is way better than the millions others chargers I have purchased. It charges my phone as fast as the original charger. The only downside of a wireless charger (in general ) is that I have to take off my phone case (Which gives me anxiety) in order for my phone to properly charge. If the manufacturers could work on that, that would be great!
","
Does what it’s supposed to do, smaller than I expected. I like my bigger tozo charging pad but this one is more powerful but you have to put your phone in the exact spot for the MagSafe to connect. One night it said it did but I guess not and I woke up to a nearly dead phone.
","
Love the color & how simple it looks. What I didn’t really like is the fact it didn’t come with it’s own adapter or even a long enough wire. I tried ordering a 10ft cord but the plug in I can’t get the right fit. But overall am happy with my purchase, definitely easier to charge wireless then the wired chargers & also it charges with my case on which is a big plus!!!
","
I always give my grandson money for his birthday but like to add a small gift to open. He loved the charger because it was so fast. This is a very nice inexpensive gift for a teenager.
","
Works great on an iPhone SE and an iPhone XR. The only thing I don't care for is the LEDs on the surface of it. They're a little too bright at night when it's on the bedside table.
","
Charges powerfully enough to go through a glass top and still charge devices, but only barely, and not as good as a previous version. The charging indicator lights a re great, too, but only go partially around the outside of the ring, making them useless for larger devices.They’re as advertised: travel well (thin) and reasonably powered, and will charge through a phone case when laid directly on top (just not through my glass table top and a case together)I ended up buying a separate MagSafe charger to use with my phone case as I have these under glass and next to one another for multiple devices.
","
I bought this charger as part of the deal for the T6 headphones. I like the rubber grips at the bottom and the green indicator light. Seems to recognize my phone right away. The only thing is that I am not sure how I feel about the USB-C adapter. I am hearing that a lot of devices are moving towards this, but it’s a bit inconvenient as I have to keep track of this additional cord now.
","
So far this charger has worked great for me. I just travelled from East coast to West coast and back again with it and it worked flawlessly, plus it is very slim and super easy to pack.The base lights up green when not charging and blue when device is charging. Both colors of light are very subtle, but obvious. You won't have trouble with having to shielding your eyes at night or plastering tape or sticky-notes over the lights so you aren't blinded through your eyelids like some chargers out there.The charger also works perfectly with the new Airpods as well as my iPhone X with a slim charging case. I don't have an Otterbox or the like so I can't comment on power penetration through larger cases, but I've had no negative experience so far.Charger only comes with the base and USB cable so you'll have to use your own or purchase an AC/USB-A charger block adapter.
","
Good charger, more sturdy than a lot of wireless chargers. My boyfriend keeps destroying the charging ports on his phone so he's been wireless charging for a few years and this one is the toughest yet! Charges at a good rate, not too fast but definitely bot slow. Great for work, plug it in in the back room and get a few minutes of power whenever possible, easy peasy.
","
I got this charger, because I went through a bunch of charging cables that wouldn't last long. This little guy is small,  charges the phone fast enough for my needs and is easy to use. I love the fact that I don't have to deal with a discharged phone anymore. The only draw back is that it doesn't work with my magnetic iPhone cover. Other than that I am very pleased with it.
","
You must have your phone in a certain position. Not a big deal when you learn how to set it down. I have found the code that comes with the phone will loosen up with time and the phone will fail to charge sometimes
","
While quite small (only 1 device at a time will fit), it absolutely does its job efficiently. I use it on my desk at work, and it quickly charges all of my devices, so it being small isn't a big deal. It also looks great when a device isn't on it. Will definitely be buying more as gifts!
","
I bought one for both my girlfriend and I. Packaging itself is very professional and nicely packaged. Removed and installed at my computer desk for ease of use and it’s the best thing I’ve added to my desk. I don’t have to worry about plugging in a wire to my phone and if overtime it would rip or tear causing charging issues. If I could change anything it would be the length of the charging cable, but even the one provided is great quality, just the length that gives me issues due to where my ports are. Other than that this charger feels and looks high quality. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!
","
Purchased this wireless charger for my nightstand and it works just fine. I had a small issue when I put my 8plus on the charger while listening to a podcast and fell asleep. By morning the charger had turned itself off most likely due to overheating. Would not recommend charging phone while it’s in use. After unplugging charger and allowing it to cool, it’s working fine again after plugging back in. I like the sleek look and charging lights. Green for charger being on and ready, blue for phone being charged. It’s not the fastest charger but my phone is at 100% by morning. I prefer this over continually plugging and unplugging the phone. May purchase a second one for the family room as well. Works fine with the standard iPhone outlet charger.
","
The green light turns blue when charging which is nice because normally we charge our phones overnight and the blue color is less bright. However you can position your phone to block all the lights. I have a 12mini so it feels like it has to be placed directly in the perfect spot for the wireless to take effect. I gave it a 4/5 for charge power because the phone definitely charges faster wired, but this wireless charger certainly does work!
","
So lets be honest it's a wireless charger. Not much to get super stoked about but this charger looks very very nice.The aluminum bottom feels expensive and the glass top is very nice as well. I went with the white one and man does it look great I have it sitting on my computer desk on my massive mouse pad. It actually makes my setup look better.Only thing i'll say is because the top is glass the phones slide really easily but everything else is well made.. Oh also the USB-C cable they provide is not the best. Works but not amazing.
","
I am so happy that I got to purchase this product, at the beginning I feel a little unsure of buying it since the price is so low that it made me doubt of the quality.  I can say that I was totally wrong, I feel ile this is the best investment of my life lol!!! The item is so good, that it charges my phone in a decent time frame, it is elegant and so functional. My parents al also taking advantage of it since it is compatible with android as well so I'm thinking to get 2 more for them as well. I can say this is a win to me and I fully recomend it to other people. It is making my life way easier than before!!!!!
","
So, recently my charger broke inside of my phone and I’d honestly drop the brand of it if I knew it just to let you guys know not to get it because it happened to my brother too, both around the same time and with no sign of it even being damaged. But anyways, I obviously need to be able to charge my phone, so I decided to get a wireless charger until I can remove the broken piece from my charging port. This one is amazing. It’s light, small, and sleek. It charges rather fast and doesn’t cause my phone to overheat or seem overwhelmed. Definitely a good purchase.
","
I just upgraded from my ancient 6s to an iphone 11.  This charger is the bee's knees!  So nice to just place your phone on top of it and it just charges it through induction.  I like the Otter Defender cases and the rubber seal they use over the charging port makes it a pain to plug the phones into the charger.  This solves that problem!  It also charges just fine through the thick plastic and rubber of the otter box.  Impressive!
","
I love this charger I leave it at my desk so it makes it super convenient to just set my phone down while I sit to do some work. The charger lights up green when its plugged in letting you know its on. The light then turns blue once you set your phone down to charge. I have also noticed that once my phone is at 100 percent it stops charging my phone on its own. It is not a fast charger so it will charge your phone at the same pace a regular charger would charge your phone.
","
I am pleased with this product as I have been using it for a week now with no issues. The lighting feature on the pad is nice letting me know it ready with a green light and purple indicating that the devices is inline with the charging pad properly and is being charged. I tested my Samsung Note 8 with different cases to determine interference with the connection for charging, Otter Box and any other cases that are thick will not allow for a charge connection. Though this goes for all charging pads. Best to have a light weight case or no case at all. I do enjoy the fact that I do not have to worry about cable connections with this charging pad. Yes, it is has charging. The same amount of fast charging you get when you connect your original fast charging cable that came with your phone. So far I am happy with this device.
","
It works well. Charge fast
","
I got it in blue to match my iPhone 12 Pro Max in Pacific Blue that's in the mail. I thought I'd prefer if the top to be blue as well but, honestly, the grippy surface is much better. I charged an iPhone X on it and worried that it would shift too much to charge regularly but the grip offered by the surface helped a lot! It is also subtly sparkly which is nice. I think charging it with DND on would be the best way to avoid shifts but it was less of a problem than I had anticipated. I am so looking forward to using this with my new phone!
","
Very nice looking charger. Easy to use. Before this, I was fiddling in the dark to plug in the lightning cable before I go to bed and was afraid that I might damage the phone INTU connector. But now all I have to do is to place the phone on the device. Nice it has the green light to place the phone correctly. Very reasonably priced. I saw them at Costco the other day amd they are much more expensive there. I think I will get one for my wide also. Highly recommend.
","
Fast, portable for travel, light weight, works great
","
I got a new Samsung S20 5G.  When I plugged in the wireless charger using the Samsung power supply and cable nothing happened.  Plugged that supply and cable into the phone and it works.  Hmm.  I still had the power supply and cable for the my previous Pixel 2 XL.  Tried that, and it works well.  Not sure if there is some tolerance out of wack with the Samsung connector, but the google one works so I am happy.
","
I was not expecting such a sleek looking product. This thing looks so nice and so far has worked just like it said it would. It’s thin but very sturdy feeling. I would recommend this to anyone who asks. The price point is amazing too! The only thing is it doesn’t come with the wall adapter but if you’re like me you have a million lying around the house so it wasn’t a deal breaker for me. I can use this for my iPhone, AirPods, and watch. My husband uses galaxy and it also worked for that too.
","
It's a very good deal, i like the color and design, y too thin, and faster, i like too much
","
I wish there was more instructions provided with the item. I had to go to the Amazon reviews to figure out if the lights would be different colors or how I would know if it’s charging. You do have to charge It before you can use it. It does a great job though. Flashes green when it needs to charge, blue when it is charging the phone. Solid green when it’s charging.
","
Plug it in and it's ready to use.  I was impressed that it charged my iphone with a soft silicone case without any problem.  Charging speed is slower than my Apple plug in charger but still acceptable.
","
Funciona correctamente y no se calienta, es muy cómodo de llevar.
","
I have a Popsocket on the back of my phone. It's a removable one, but I wanted to see if I didn't need to take it off to charge. My phone was able to charge wireless with it still on. Also have a thin phone case on as well when testing it.
","
This is an great buy. It works great and led lights that change when your phone is charging are super helpful to make sure you phone is still charging. The only thing that is a little difficult is the pop socket on my phone. When I sit it on the charger it sometimes doesn’t pick up right away. But the product works great!
","
They worked well, but wasnt something that I cared to use.  It did make it easier to quickly place my phone on the night stand and not worry if I hit the ""bullseye"" of my charger pad.  Issue was that it didnt magnetize to my phone through the case and it takes longer to remove the case than just plug it in.  Spend the money on a higher wattage quick charger brick and cord!
","
Looks previously used . Scratches on top and filthy cable not bound up .Seems to work so I'll keep it.
","
I have a Samsung phone, it charged to slow
","
The unit looks very sleek and classy. It is very thin and looks like black glass with lighted accents. The lights are not too bright and don't affect my sleeping even though it is right next to me on the night stand. I have not had the unit very long. If anything does occur I will update my review. Works as advertised and looks better in person.
","
It's a great charger that's for damn sure. Charges my Pixel lightening quick! The looks and overall design is gorgeous especially the bright LEDs to tell you if it's charging. My only big issue is that it doesn't have any grip to it at all. My phone just kinda slides about when it's on top. Which will sometimes take it off the charging area. Other than that one issue, it's a great charger!
","
This is a decent alternative to the true MagSafe Charger.  I have two of the Apple units and always hated the requirements to power them, must be USB-C PD at least 18W, etc. While this doesn't charge at 15W, you can use a standard USB-A with at least 2A (10W) and it will charge at 7.5W.  It even comes with a USB-C to USB-A adapter. Doesn't get hot.  Magnet works as well as MagSafe.  The fact that it's black means it wont get as dirty as the white cable and pad.  Overall happy with performance and value.
","
It works great even with the case on and I love it but it does charge slow that’s my only complaint. It’s great for traveling and easy to use.
","
This is by far the best wireless charger I've purchased. I have purchased pricie ones from my carrier costing as much as $80 and it took so long to charge my phone.  I took it right back and got this one.  It's really slim and elegant, has an expensive look to it. Oh and the  light is so suttle it doesn't bother me when I'm asleep.  Big plus for me and sold me immediately is that you place the phone down and it's charging.  No wiggles or moving it around to get it to charge.  I bought a this one based on the reviews and the slim sleek look and I am happier than I expected, and it cost so much less. Wireless charging is not fast but this one does the job pretty fast.  If you are thinking of buying this, don't think anymore.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
","
I have ordered two of these since I loved the 1st one so much. Also gave one as a gift. So convenient to put along your night stand or keep on the kitchen counter. My 1st one died on me. I contacted TOZO via email and with a few messages back an forth they gladly replaced the device in order to keep me as a customer. Thank You TOZO.
","
This charging pad is about as simple as it can get, and works very well for my phone, earbuds, and tablet. I have it on my desk and use it all the time.
","
When placed perfectly, your phone will charge fast. However, it's all too easy to just miss the charging spot, and let your phone rest overnight without charging. The most annoying feature however is the LED. The green is on all of the time and is super SUPER bright. So bright it lights up the bedroom. The LED turns to blue when actually charging your device, which surprisingly is dimmer than the green. In any case, the LED doesn't need to be on all of the time, and doesn't need to be this bright. Otherwise, a pretty good charger, and it is extremely thin and light.
","
I recently upgraded to a phone with wireless charging capability and this is the first wireless charger I have purchased. This is an excellent charger with superb design and represents, in terms of design, a significant step up from the most inexpensive models available. The charging pad is beautifully finished on its top surface and edges and has a non-slip base. The provided USB to mini-USB cable will plug into any USB power outlet and the charging performance appears excellent. Recognition of the presence of the phone is essentially instantaneous whereupon the LED bands (two, visible in the photo) turn from green to blue. The colors are very attractive and, since placed on the top surface, unobtrusive (there would be no concern about sleep interruption if this were placed on a nightstand). The unit is small and light and would make an excellent travel charger. In summary, this is a superbly designed and manufactured charger. Highly recommended.
","
The product works great and can be used as a night light. The only negative is that it comes without an AC connector.
","
Plug and go, it’s very slim and nice looking. Got the black and when you put the phone on it it changes to flashing blue light , once it’s charged it goes blue. Can basically place the phone anywhere orotund the center , it’s not very piniky! And that’s a good thing. Very happy with this , it works with a case on my phone , looks great and does what it’s supposed to. It doesn’t charge as fast as the wall cable that you have to buy for the phone but I set it down before bed and it’s charged by morning . Highly recommend this!
","
It is very slim and handy for traveling. IPhone 12 is charging slow than direct plugged in
","
Looks good, charges wirelessly, but does it charge that fast to me? Not particularly, I'd say it delivers a standard charge. I like to charge my wireless headphone case on it, and when I'm charging the case via a USB-C it tends to charge faster. Maybe I just don't know enough about what fast charging is on a wireless charger compared to a direct plug, so that's something to keep in mind but do your research.Overall, if you don't need your device in the snap of a finger, this could work. I think the most ideal place would either be your desk at work, the side table near your favorite seating area at home, or your nightstand next to your bed. That way you can see it and be reminded that you should charge your device while you're working, sleeping, or playing.
","
Convenient for phones and for the TOZO earbuds I've had for awhile (which I didn't know until now). The only problem I can even think of is the awkward charging. Sometimes it takes awhile to find the exact spot where I should place my phone for it to charge. And then sometimes it fast charges while other times it doesn't. Either way, it's still just a convenient, mostly hassle free way to charge devices.
","
Slow charger, but works good enough for the price.  Hoped to charge my phone too, couldn't do it, lost battery while using Spotify.
","
These take FOREVER to charge my Apple phone. Not worth the hassle, just as easy to insert a charger.
","
I was a little skeptical about this at first but it is able to charge my phone pretty quick even through my OtterBox case. I love being able to rest my phone on this rather than having to find my cord and plug it in.  The only downside is if you have it on your bedside table, there are two blue lights that change in hue while the phone is charging, and when it is at 100% it turns green. (It also stays green even when not in use as long as it's plugged in.) Although, the light doesn't bother me and you are able to cover it up with your phone altogether! I love this charger. It also comes with a 1-year manufacturer guarantee so I know I'm set if something happens to it! I love this charger!

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's very sleek and stylish charger. As you can see in video when it is connect to wall charger, led light is green and when you place your phone it turns blue indicating that phone is charging. Phone used is iPhone 11 with case, so you can see the size of charger against the phone, and it doesn't matter if phone goes out of charger. It should work with iPhone pro max models too. Very convenient and stylish product. One thing to note that it comes with cable but not wall adapter, you can use your old iphone or samsung adapters with the given cable.
","
This device works well. Was surprised that it even charges up my iPhone. One thing, though -- I have to move what I want charged around a bit on the surface otherwise it won't charge. A small quibble, but I thought I was recharging something and in the morning, found out it wasn't charged at all.  Once I figured out that placement is important, I've not had this issue since.
","
Got it got my  wife's iPhone13 so she didn't have to find the cable and connect.No she just puts the phone down
","
When I first got it and plugged it in it wasn’t working, it would turn on and off. Then I changed the cube that I had put on to another one and now it works perfectly. So if it isn’t working double check all aspects of the product
","
This product is very thin. It is very easy to use and very convenient for traveling. I enjoy not having to constantly plug in my phone everytime. The surface is big enough and even charged through my phone case. I was shocked by how quick it charged my phone as well. I high recommend this to my friends and family if they want to make their lives more convenient :)
","
It works well. I don't like that the light stays on all the time. And my earbuds are warm when I take them out though they were charged hours ago. I'm going to put it on a timer.
","
I got this back in August of 2019 and it was hardly ever used. Now having problems charging my iPhone 12 Pro with the cable so when I got this out to use it, it failed. It would quit charging before the devise was charged. Now it doesn't do anything.  Waste of money for the use I got out of it.
","
Got this charging station back in July, in hopes to use it at work since my iPhone battery drains pretty fast nowadays.Anyway, received the package in excellent conditions, the color is very nice, no complaints about that, but here are the cons to this product:- It is not wireless. Charging port must be plugged in at all times if you’re to charge your phone.- It charges your phone REALLY slow.- While it may be thin, it is pretty big and can be annoying in your handbag or workspace if it’s small.So my main issue is with it not being wireless nor charging quickly.My phone charges faster when it’s plugged in to its original iPhone charger and other chargers, but not this one.With this charger, you can leave your phone on it for twenty minutes and it’ll only have moved about 10%. So if your phone is at 2% and you check back in 20, you’ll see your phone is now at 12%.On a regular plug-in charger, in twenty minutes, my phone will already have been at 60% if not more.I wish I could return the item but it’s too late for me. I’ll be giving it to someone else who could maybe use it at night time while they sleep. Hopefully they wake up to a fully charged phone.
","
This is a sharp looking wireless charger. I had a different brand prior to this. It stopped working after about a year so I thought I'd try this one. I always leave my phone case on. This charger will not work with my phone case on. I returned it.
","
THis product did not always charge y phone even though it showed that it was charging.  I don't have this issue with my other chargers.
","
The charger is very sleek and appealing to the eye but it sadly didn’t work for my iPhone 12 Pro Max. The light on the charger itself is green but neither phones will charge. Not sure if it’s the charger itself or our phones but the photos provided with the product show an iPhone.
","
On the occasion that this item works, it does what it's supposed to do. I set my phone on it before bed, and it's fully charged when I get up the next morning...or, I very often find, it hasn't done a thing. The device has four different indicator lights;  solid green, blinking green, solid blue, and blinking two tone blue. Of course, since the device did not include any sort of instruction manual, I have no idea exactly what any of these lights mean, and a visit to the Tozo website has a link to the device guide, which is a dead link that takes you nowhere. Amazon's list of features details: ""Changing color breath LED lights. Bueatiful (their spelling, not mine) and lets you know when it's ready to charge, charging, and when your device is fully charged."" If you're OK with spending $12 on an item that intermittently works, I would still recommend  you keep looking.
","
I'm using it to charge a Sony Xperia 1 III. I have to 30watt type C charger on it, I'm assuming it's charging at pads maximum 15watt capacity and I get only about 10% increase every .5hrs... Seems slow if the 30watt charger gives me 80% capacity in 30 mins. I only use it while I'm sleeping. It does get warm.
","
Overall it’s nice charger. Seems to be well made and it looks sleek and cool. It says it has fast charging capabilities, but you need to get the “right” cord or wall unit with the appropriate  strength to be able to get the fast charging features so I wish that came with the charger to begin with. Also, if you wanted to travel with it then find a bag to put it in because it doesn’t come with one. Most of the ones I looked at has bags for the charger but this one does not.
","
This charger is neat being my first wireless charger! I'm using it now as I write this review. I bought this scared my normal charge port was messed up and i didn't feel like going to a repair shop. Its smaller than expected I thought it would be the size of my galaxy s9+ but thats not a criticism. I love the sleek small look. It charges fast as well if not the same or a little faster than default charger. I have no complaints!Edit: Don't forget if you have a protection case to take it off for an even faster charge! I always keep my phones strapped ever since I cracked and broke my beloved s7 lol.
","
Mostly a piece of garbage, but it's sleek and nice to look at. Using it as a coaster

Hello,I was excited by the reviews so I purchased 2 of these and white and black. I had my phone charging at 26% and came back later found it 28% total time about 2 hours. So I decided to charge the adapter I have some high end ones that are USB 3.0 Fast chargers works fine with the phone cable.  I had that running while watching Amazon prime movie and found it charged 33% .That was the black shiny one I purchased - Something is wrong with it or the unit just stinks for charging.The white one I purchased has different results that got to 80% in 2.5 hours for charging.I see it charging for a few seconds and stops. I also see that the surface is soo slippery and take this as a warning if you don't have it precise it wont charge.  I went back to cable this is more of a pain to get it to charge and not even a good charge.The way these should work is that you just place it down and let it charge and that is not happening
","
It's ok. Small and simple. Doesn't fast charge but better than nothing. Main reason why I bought it was my ear bud charging case will not charge off a cord anymore and I wasn't about to buy new buds just because of the case. It worked. I'm good.
","
I bought a black color. Kind of satin finish and great magnetic attachment!
","
I have experienced multiple times when I thought I had plugged in my charging cable, only to find out the connector  didn't go all the way in (due to the phone case I have) and my phone wasn't fully charged when I was ready to start my day.  I was amazed how easy this charger takes care of my low-charge/no-charge worries.  The charger takes up less space than my phone so I didn't need to make room for it.  Even with the case and holster I use, I just lay the back side  of my phone down (holster still attached) on the charger and it charges through the case!  In the morning it's a one-handed pickup and go.  The charging light is easy to cover up with the phone so it doesn't give off light in a dark room.  This charger is a great buy.

The charger looks great and I love that the color changes when it’s charging but if you are sensitive to light this is not a charger you should keep in your bedroom for night time charging.
","
Super easy to install; just plug in the cord via the usb type c side and plug the usb side into your laptop’s USB port or in a wall charger. It’s ready to charge any of your products that have wireless charging available. For me, I got this specifically for my iPhone and earbuds.Charging power is good but slower than plugging in your phone. However this was something I knew but still wanted to have a product where I could just put down my phone instead of fiddling with cords all the time. Very easy to use.
","
This would have been great at home, but it did not maintain connection with my phone in the car. It was in a secure location where it wouldn't slide around. I do have a thin clear case, but that didn't matter when I tried it out of the car. Looks very nice and it was very simple to use. I recommend it for home use but not car use.
","
I ordered this when I had an I phone 8 and I never really had a problem. I just upgraded to a 12 and it charges just fine but I have to make sure it’s positioned a certain way. It’s kind of sensitive about where my phone has to be. Otherwise it will blink in blue or go back to green (not charging).
","
I really enjoyed this product. I have other charging pads that are bigger but not as fast/efficient as this one. My favorite feature of the TOZO W6 is the magnet. It connects to your phone and allows you to hold your phone up and charge it at the same time. I also like that it comes with a USB port so that you can charge from any power source.This wireless charger is very compact and sleek, making it look nice on your bedside table and good for travel.
","
Surprisingly good packaging and documentation. The LEDs aren’t obnoxious and convey wether an item is charging or charged. Works flawlessly with my Tozo T6 wireless earbuds and iPhone 11. I purchased this charger to replace a letscom wireless charger that died after a week. Both were attractive, but the Tozo wins because of the LEDs. It also feels like much higher build quality. To boot, it’s a couple dollars less than the letscom. I will update this review if there are any problems, so if you don’t see an update, it’s still working perfectly!
","
It doesn’t go through my case which is a bummer but over all I really like it. I bought a white one and a black one. I wish I would’ve just got two black because the white one has lights that show when it is charging and when it’s not and I hate any lights in my bedroom at night! The black only has a small light indicating power.
","
Have next to my bed. My iPhone SE 2020 charges on it . In the morning after at least 7 hours it is still on 5 percent. The charging symbol on phone is on. The charger is on with blue lite.But phone is not charged.It is not in case and lies on disk perfectly.This happens about 50 percent of the time.I highly suggest not buying this.Not reliable.I am a IT manger so I know what I am doing.Unhappy—————————————————Update: 7-24-2020I am pleased to say that TOZO has wonderful customer service.Lyn is their customer service person. She has done everything possible to make me a happy customer.I am happy. Would definitely buy your products again.Thank you TOZO

The product was great on IPhone 12, IPhone X but nonfunctional on iPhones 7. Lol It is an older phones maybe that’s why, make sure t use a lighting charger so it’s better.
","
Wanted to try this but the cord is too short. Would work if you plug into your laptop at work station.
","
This product is lightweight and can be placed just about anywhere there is a USB or plug-in receptacle, which is quite  convenient. I also like that the color indicator changes from green to blue when the charge is complete.It would be much better if: 1) it HELD a charge, rather than having to be plugged in all the time; and 2) it were providing a FAST charge for my device. It took over 2 hours to charge my phone from 5% to 58%. I had to plug my phone into its fast charger to get it to 100%, which took less than 10 minutes.
","
Bought 2 of these and love them.  Easy to plunk iPhone on and charge.  I have them on our nightstands.  I want to point out that the Gray and the Matte Black ones I bought do not have semi-circular lights on top or bottom, just a pinpoint dot of light on the rim.  This is fine with me, as some reviewers found the other ones too bright for the bedroom.  I'm guessing the chargers with a matte finish do not have the semi-circular lights. I have successfully charged iPhone 12s and Airpods Pro on them for 3 weeks.
","
I was in the market to buy another wireless charger for my bedroom when I sleep. This charger looked impressive when I was browsing and I decided to order it.I had this device for a couple of months and it still works very well. No problems whatsoever, it still charges my iPhone 12 Pro Max at a good rate. Plus, it is visually pleasing, not bad for its price.Worth buying for anyone who may need a wireless charger.
","
Easy
","
I bought three of these.  One for my wife, One for me at home, and one to take on the road while I am traveling for work.  They work great.  It even works with the protective cover on my wife's phone.  It will not work with my cover on the phone as I have a metal plate attached to mount the phone in my car when traveling.  But I do not mind taking the cover off to charge it.  The light on it is dim enough that it is not bothersome at night.  Works well for us.
","
I bought this to charge my phone while at work. Works great and charges well. Very convenient for those of us who need our phones often during the work day
","
I got this charger for an iPhone. It looks very nice and modern. It charges way slower than I would like but it does the trick for charging my phone overnight.If u need a lightning charger this isn’t it.
","
This charger is great! I use it every day, and it's such a simple gadget that I would recommend it for anyone. It looks nice, it charges pretty fast, and I love not having to mess with a cord. 10/10 :)
","
I misunderstood the reviews for another item and thought that I needed a wireless charger for that item. So, I got this. Turns out, I didn't need it after all but I like it! It charges everything so well, it looks cool, I love how it changes colors from green to blue, and I ended up using it to charge the aforementioned item anyway.
","
I've only had this a little over a month and it worked great for a couple of weeks charging my phone quickly. But now it takes hours upon hours to charge. The cable charges my phone super fast but the plate is pretty much useless. Not to mention it overheats my phone sometimes as it charges on the plate. I was really hoping with as many reviews on this product and how high the rating is I'd have been lucky to find the perfect product to wirelessly charge my phone.UPDATE! Now the charging pad is overheating like mad and burned my fingers. I'm very displeased with this product. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
","
I was kind of bummed because I guess this thing can't charge certain phones? I placed my phone on it and it didn't work. I also wonder if it is because of my ring holder. But no worries we use them for our earpods/airports. It's slick and pretty, the light turns blue when something is charging and green when it is free. Definitely recommend for simple wireless charging.
","
I put off buying a wireless charger for years, but finally caved after my roommate got this exact one and I saw how thin, sleek, and aesthetic it looked. I love how convenient it is to use, just setting my devices down without having to worry about plugging anything in.I got the charger in gray, while my roommate has the white one. The light panels are larger on the white, while it’s just one tiny light that alternates from green to blue to indicate charging. If you are highly sensitive to light in your sleep, the gray one might be a better option, although I don’t think the lights on the white one are super disruptive either!One thing to note, this wireless charger will not charge Apple Watches! But I have had no problem charging my iPhone X, 11, or AirPods on it.
","
This is totally awesome for ease of us, but it doesn’t charge near as fast as a cord.
","
I am new to the world of wireless charging but the reviews on the Tozo earbuds were quite good and these chargers came up recommended.  After some searching, I purchased two.  Because I’m a little vain about my technology, I appreciated the color options and how nice they looked when they arrived.  I had no trouble charging my phone on it when it first arrived, and the indicator lights worked exactly as they should.  I haven’t tested the life span, clearly, since I just got the chargers, but I’m happy with them so far!
","
I purchased this for my new iPhone 11. Used it two nights, my phone was acknowledging that it was on the charger but my charge never increased. It sat on the charger for hours and it never increased the charge from the 38% it was when I placed my phone on it. I wish it would have worked for me but unfortunately, it was a waste of my money.Update: Customer service contacted me and the issue is now resolved. I was impressed with their professionalism. We also bought one for my husband at the same time (grey one) and it is working fantastic! I am sure I just got a faulty charger.
","
Great  product.  No complaints.  Isn’t as fast as some of my plug in chargers, but faster than others.  However, if you add into the equation the time you save by just placing it on the pad, it’s as fast, or faster than any plug in charger. And extremely more convenient.I’m ordering several for Christmas presents and more for myself.I highly recommend this product.
","
Bueno
","
It’s thin enough to sit on the stand behind my iPhone 12 Pro Max. It charges well enough. The sweet spot seems quite large.My only nit is that the light changes from green to blue when the phone is in the correct position. I would prefer that it change from blue or yellow to green, but that’s probably a cultural thing.
","
Easy, but turn your phone off if you don't want intermittent noise while charging
","
It’s a pretty good charger. It’s nice and easy for when I am ready to charge my phone. My only complaint is that you have to place your phone just right for it to charge. When you just place it down not completely the way it needs to go it doesn’t charge. Other than that it’s easy to use.
","
I love this wireless charging pad and I wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is very thin and compact so it takes up hardly any space at all on my table. It charges my wireless earbuds VERY quickly and with no hassle--you only need to set the item to be charged on top of the pad and it begins charging. The LED on the side of the charging pad turns blue when it is charging so you know it's working. Finally, the charging pad itself looks very premium and classy in the black color.Overall, it's a great product and I highly recommend it!
","
I LOVE the way it looks, and it does charge my phone (overnight), but I don't think it's the best thing for my phone.  It shows 100% charged in the morning, but the charge doesn't stay - I have to charge again by bedtime.  With the regular USB-C charge cable I only need to charge every 2-3 days.A very attractive wireless option, but I won't be using it for my phone anymore - not sure what it's doing to the battery.  Phone is a Pixel 6 Pro.
","
Found out this charger doesn’t work with a magnet on the back of my phone. (It’s for a magnetic holder in my car).  I didn’t see any info on this before I bought it and was hoping it would work. It does not, so I need to return. Sad, because it looks real nice but not able to use it.Update: the company reached out to offer compensation or another product to make things right.  I decided to keep the wireless charger and ordered the Tozo wireless earbuds and they work great with the charge. I really appreciate the great customer service andi love my new earbuds.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!
","
My only complaint is that the light is always on even when the device is not charging my phone. So I just flip it upside down when I’m not using it. Other than that it works great and I’ve had no issues.
","
So I first bought a wireless charger that worked fine but the blue LED light was way too bright and would randomly flicker or turn off for a few seconds and then pop back on. Kind of annoying. I returned it and went with this Tozo Wireless Charger instead. Should have bought this in the first place. The LED lights are a non-factor. They stay green when not in use and turn blue when a device is being charged. Either way they emit very little light, and in fact placing a phone on the charger can cover the lights. I have the iPhone 11 Pro with an Apple Silicone Case and it charges great. I suppose the ultimate test of any electronic device is how well it holds up over time, so time will tell; but it does come with a one year warranty. I highly recommend the Tozo Wireless Charger.
","
I was excite to order this charger because it allegedly charges iPhones x% faster than all the others.  Esthetically, it's very sleek and appealing.  Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver the miracle it promises.  I put this charger and a 12 Pro Max next to a different brand and older model charger with another 12Pro Max.  They charged at the same speed.  I also discovered that my phone would tend to slide off it if not perfectly flat.  I promptly returned the charger
","
This is the most convenient product I have purchased.  It is so much easier to lay my phone down and and receive a charge.  I don’t have to worry about the cable on a regular charger to wear and have to replace from bending it.
","
My case is too thick for it to work properly, but when the case is off, it works great.  Works well for phones that have a damaged charging port
","
I’ve used this charging pad over chargers for months. It’s easy to just lay my phone on it and let it charge through the night. It doesn’t charge too quickly but overnight it fully charges my phone and I’m ready to go in the morning. It’s very easy to pack into anything and doesn’t take up really any space at all. 10/10
","
I ordered this wireless charger yesterday and received it today.  I was happy that it came in pink, as that is one of my favorite colors.  It's compact, completely portable, and it does charge well, but I thought the concept was that it would charge without needing to be plugged in at all.  But it's still convenient that I can have my phone charge without having the main slot occupied, and I'm able to use it for my headphones.  I really like it and look forward to having it for a long time.
","
My daughter loves this item because it is ""fancy and works great.""
","
I was originally thrown off by the ""NO AC Adaptor"" Comment and then I realized I have about 500 laying around my house. This product is gorgeous on my desk and is exactly what I wanted. It's light weight and has grips on the bottom so it doesn't slide around/off your desk.  It also changes color so you know it's charing, but the light is not as blinding as my last one when trying to fall asleep.  This is an ultimate definite buy. It charged my phone pretty fast as well.
","
Product works as advertised.  I purchased one for every bedroom in our home.  Guests love it.
","
Although convenient, this product does not keep my phone charged. It also does not charge a phone if you have it at all slightly off of position and sometimes stops charging. It takes a long time to gain any charge. I had such high hopes, I will continue to search for a good wireless phone charger.
","
Works well with my work cell but not with my personal cell
","
Looks like I have money to burn. This thing looks like something Apple would charge $200 for, and it charges my phone, battery case, and EarPods easily.It will charge my iPhone 11 Pro, right through the silicone case, as long as I detach the pop socket part the way it’s designed to do.It charges and the light changes from green to blue to say it sees your device and is charging.I have not checked to see if it can charge faster than I can use power on a video. I have watched some, with it charging, and I think it was charging but I know it didn’t get lower. It would have died.The EarPods case is perfect for this.I’m going to order at least one more, maybe a few.
","
I had my phone on this charger for about 30 minutes and it only charged from 10% to 20%, its super slow. I do like how convenient it is and that I can keep it on a desk to keep my phone charged, but I wouldn't choose it over Apple chargers.

Bought this product based on shortened description, not realizing it was only for newer model iPhones. When it didn’t work for my iPhone 7S, I visited their website and the purchased the adapter they recommended. When that didn’t work, I returned the original product and received a replacement. When that also didn’t work, I tried putting my phone in the special case that my previous charger required and it works just fine. I learned to look at the full product description before ordering and to not order from just the shortened description!
","
I have now bought 4 of these chargers because I like them so much. They work great and look very nice unlike some wireless chargers that are all plastic and stand out. I have one on my desk at work, in my kitchen, in my bedroom, and bought one for my mother. They’re subtle and easy to use. Multiple people at work use it due to its convenience and have asked me where it’s from. I have multiple colors and they are they to the advertised pictures. Highly recommend!
","
Wanted a portable charge for my travel that was easy to set up and didn't take up much room in backpack.  This is it.I use at home as well.  Easy to set up in hotel room. Simple to set iPhone or AirPod Pros on.  Don't have to be super picky about placement. I do wish it came with a simple carrying case in order to protect from scratches, dirt, etc. during travel. But other than that this fits my needs.  It seems to be constructed well.  I have only traveled with it 3 times since purchase 2 months ago. So far so good.  Will re-review if it doesn't hold up.  But for now...5 stars.
","
This is a great charger for the money.  The charger works as described.  The only thing I don't like is that the phone can sometimes get knocked off the charger and the phone seems to need to be placed just right to charge.  The charger is sleek looking, but may benefit by a rubber coating so the phone doesn't slide.  I have woken up to an uncharged phone on occasion, but it is my own fault for knocking it askew.I would definitely purchase again and recommend to others.
","
Product is as described, looks good, works fine for my pixel 5, but does not work with Galaxy watch 4. I wish there was something clearer to let me know it wasn't compatible before purchasing.
","
This is my second charger.  I purchased Black the first time with the charging indicators on the top of the pad. The second charger was the royal blue and it has a rubber top and the charge indicator is on the edge of the device. I prefer the indicators on top and wouldn’t have ordered blue if I knew that. Harder to see but doesn’t effect the charging. I bought the first to charge my Tozo earbud case and it charges my iPhone SE as well. I purchased the second so I could have one elsewhere in the house. For the price they’re hard to beat. Reliability so far has been excellent.
","
Looks nice, slim, the light of the plate changes when the phone is on top. My biggest problem is that the charging power is low. I have a Samsung Galaxy note ultra s20 and even if i leave it for 3 hours, it only charges 40%. Is good for second option but it will not replace your traditional charger.
","
I don't take it traveling, but so cool to just flop the phone on it and let it do it's thing!  I hate the iPhone cords, 50% of the time they refuse to make good contact and you never know if the phone will charge - especially with pocket lint in there! This eliminates that issue!
","
Fast charging, slim sleek design with easily seen green and blue light indicators so you know when a charge is happening. Love the low profile design, doesn’t take up much space and has base grip so it stays in place and doesn’t slide around. Works to charge everything! Phones, watches and earbuds everything get juice! Speaking of earbuds this brand has amazing Bluetooth earbuds. Love this company brand. They also provide a free long extended warranty if by chance a product ever has any issues. Great brand great service equals happy customer!
","
got too hot after a short amount of time charging my airpods.
","
Very simple to plug and place. It does come with a cord but I cannot remember if it comes with a power brick. I have opted to use my fast charger usb c brick and belkin cable and I get fast charge wireless notification on my LG V60. Had it for several months and no hiccups
","
This charger looks and works great, but there are two large bright green lights that remain on at all times when there's not a phone on the unit. Great if you need a night light, but I end up having to flip it upside down as the lights were distracting even in the living room. The lights would be nearly unbearable on a night stand. They do glow blue instead of green when a phone is on it, but still a lot of light for a charger. Other brands have a soft, tiny light to show you that it's charging, and that's preferable to this.
","
A lot of wireless charging pads are really expensive,  plain black slabs, or both. I like that this little charging pad comes in many colors and finishes for a low price. It works great! One note is that you won't want to use this in the bedroom due to the bright indicator lights. Otherwise it's perfect!
","
i have yet to find an inexpensive charger that was not an apple product that would work well with an apple phone with a heavy duty case on your phone. this one i can lay my phone on it with a life time case and it has no problem charging it , i love it thank u
","
So far so good.  It was purchased as a secondary charger for my bedroom.  I bought a send one to give as a gift!
","
My galaxy s10 is giving me issues water/moisture in USB port so was forced to purchase a wireless charger. It arrived promptly was skeptical about buying the price was too low to be true. I have to say, it worked out for me! Not sure how safe it is because of the EMF it produces so I usually leave to charge where myself or family are not too close to device while it completely charges, then I disconnect.
","
I have this unit for about a week now. Used both at home and at the office. Easy and small enough to just throw it in the pocket.  The charger is pretty strong. I have a small case around my phone and most chargers don’t work unless you’re right on the mark. With this charger it’s a little forgiving and once it’s connected you can raise it about an 1” up off the charger and it still charges.  I bet it would work with thicker cases as well. But I have not tried.I would approve this product. Great sleek look and design.
","
Awesome charger for an affordable price! Great alternative to official Apple magsafe charger.It doesn’t come with a power brick but neither does Apple include one for the official charger. However it does come with a converter for usb c to usb A. So I. An use this with older power bricks that dont have USB C connectors.One thing to note is that the black version has the company branding on the top side. Magnets work just as well as the official apple charger as well. Very happy with this purchase and will probably buy another one.
","
Charger consist of led lights on the sides to let you know when it is powered on and charging. Green light indicate that is  not charging and blue light indicate that phone is charging, which makes it easy to tell whats happening. It worked on both my iphone xs and iphone 8 with a case on both about 2mm. The white color charger is more of glossy jet white with a gold brushed finishing on the back, which looks pretty like the iphone 5s color scheme. It is portable, lightweight, and slim which makes it easily fit into your pocket/purse to carry around. Very fashionable as it isn't as bulky as other wireless charger. Also comes with a 1 year warranty which is a plus. Update: Use of apple 5V 1A AC adapter cause the adapter to become hot. When switch with a 5V 2A AC, the problem is fixed. Amazon sell 10W or 5V 2A adapter for a few bucks.
","
I've been looking for a magsafe charger that will hold up my 12 pro max while driving as a car mount so many aren't strong enough and I was finally about to buy the apple one but I found this one and it works great holds it well even during hard cornering and acceleration and it fast charges it to boot my didn't have the logo on the front of the charger which I was happy about bc the plain black looks better haha
","
So I got this product and so far so good it's great so if you have light saved 80% it's great to charge it up and it's fast
","
I bought this because I was sick of constantly replacing standard chargers. This is great for putting on your desk or night stand. It is a little difficult to find the spot to put the phone in, you have to move around a bit to get the blue light  that means charging. Looks modern. Charges pretty well.
","




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 It will charge more effectively when all apps are closed out or when powered off, so nothing is running while charging. (Tip from an apple service tech).
","
This charger is very easy to set up! It’s cute, very simplistic, and super thin technology. You do have to consciously set your device on the charger right between the lit up lines in order for it to activate the charger, and it takes seemingly forever to get a full charge.
","
This charger worked well for a while--I really liked the indicator lights--and the design is very sleek. But then it just up and died after 4 months of moderate use. Fortunately, I was able to contact TOZO support, and they got back to me VERY quickly saying they could replace it. Great customer service!
","
This definitely does the job! It charges up my phone pretty fast. I have an Samsung. It nice and sleek, super thin and weightless. The wire it comes with is super short, so I needed to buy a longer one. Still would buy again.
","
This TOZO W6 Wireless Charger works very well with my iPhone 12 Pro while it is in an Otterbox case.  The charging works very well and the magnetic attachment works well too.  It looks nice on my desk and fits well in my backpack for work.  I really love this and it works VERy well with the TOZO C1 USB C Charger 20W PD Power Adapter. TOZO still continues to be very good to me. There is even an adapter for the older USB plugs.
","
Great price compared to the Apple mag safe charger. It is slightly larger, so it won't fit in stands or other products made for the mag safe charger. I use it on my nightstand for charging at night and it is excellent. Strong grip on the case, and charges quickly enough for me. I don't have any way to measure the actual charging numbers, but for sure it gets my phone to 100 percent overnight. It will be great to travel with as well.I really like this product and would definitely recommend.
","
The charger works well with one caveat, I couldn’t get it to charge my phone because of the knob on the back panel. The phone couldn’t lie flat to make full contact with the charger. It charged my wife’s phone with out a problem.
","
Bought this for my wife and she won’t use it anymore because it takes too long to charge her iphone, compared to the regular way.  I do not have specific data on hours to charge but I know it is slow. We only use it for the earpods because we dont use them very often.Edit:  ok, it seems to work so far with the earpods, but will not charge either iphone. We have a 7plus and a 11 pro max, and it now will not work with either one.  Tried different charger plugs, did not matter. The blue light does not come on (which is another problem because there are no lights on the top surface of the pad, only the single green one on the thin edge in the front. The single light in the front will turn blue when charging the earpods, but not with either iphone, although it did on the first day I got it.  The price is great, but still not worth it since it doesn’t charge the iphone. I am returning it.
","
Very simple and sleek. Charges quick. Only negative is the bright light when it's plugged in but it's not too bright and not a big deal
","
Update:I still love this charger but it stopped working boo hoo, I still give this company 5 stars and would give them more if I could.  I contacted them and told them that it stopped working and they are sending me a new one.  A company that responds within one day and actually cares about their customers is a blessing to me.  I appreciate TOZO and love this charger.  It is really sleek and beautiful and the light is not to bright in the nightPrevious review:I love this.  I have arthritis in my fingers and it is hard to plug I. The charging cord for my phone.  The TOZO charging unit makes it so easy to charge my phone. I love it.  It is not as fast as a plug in but not much slower.
","
I bought the TOZO wireless charging unit on October 14, 2020 and began using it on a daily basis. It worked fine and did a great job of charging my iPhone. I like its sleek style and the lighted ring that indicates it's plugged in. Also it changes color when you put your phone in place. In other words, it was great ... until it suddenly stopped working. However, as soon as I contacted the distributor, they immediately wrote to say they are sending me another without my even having return the old one. Now, that's what I call fantastic customer service!
","
Update: seller contacted me and offered a slew of options to rectify the issue and then some. In a world where a companies response to an issue is just as important as the product itself.Old:Product is defective. It somehow ruined two  wall outlet adapters I used with it to charge my phone. Returning product.
","
I buy alot of these chargers and leave them all over my house. I put my phones on these chargers (iPhone and Android), TOZO head phones, and etc. It's so convenient because when people come over to visit they ask for a charger and I have these wireless chargers in every room. The light changes color so u know it's charging.
","
This just works. It does what it's supposed to do, and in a small footprint. The diameter is about 3.4 inches, narrower than the W1 that I own. So, it's easy to carry in your briefcase or weekend/gig bag. It's also quite thin (2.5mm per Amazon's description). I plugged the W3 into the USB port on my desk lamp (the cable comes with), so it did not get a lot of output from that port. But it charged my iPhone 8+ from 20% to 100% in about 2.5 hours--which is faster than my older wireless charger I purchased from Costco a couple of years ago. I recommend it!
","
Love the colors and love that it prevents over charging. I bought it so I wouldn't put so much stress on my charger port. It does the job I want it to do so I can't complain too much. My only thing is that it does not charge my phone fast.
","
When you open this package you can tell it isn't one of those ""Wish"" quality wireless chargers that you see for similar prices.  This is a sturdy charger and has a USB-C charging cable when fits perfectly.Pros:Sturdy/high qualityquickly connects to the device being chargedChanges color to show that there is a connection (I hated with my previous wireless charger how I had to check the device to see if it was chargingHigh-quality cable attachmentCons:None so far If you need a wireless charger definitely get this one!

Tried 3 magnetic chargers and this one is the strongest for connecting my iPhone in a case to a car mount. Finally accomplished what I want and happy.My setup:1. iPhone 12 Pro in a MagSafe case2. Connected Wixgear car mount to car air vent3. Affixed magnetic plate (provided in Wixgear packaging) to back of the Tozo wireless charger.4. Hold Tozo charger near the car mount & then hold the iPhone (in magnetic case) near the Tozo charger.5. Plug the Tozo charger in a vehicle’s USB port.

I needed a spare to stick in my travel stuff, because this type of charger has proven to improve my life. I was surprised it came with a charging cable, and I haven't used it for a long time yet but first impression is it's very nice. Also like that the green light indicates power and turns to blue when it 'sees' the phone. Much nicer than the one from the phone store, except I do like the fabric texture surface on the more expensive one.

I’m going to order a second one for my other room!
","
This charges up the phone and wireless earbuds fast and easy. The price was perfect and a lot cheaper then the name brand charger for my phone too!
","
Every once in a while the phone doesn't charge. Have to be careful to place in the right spot.  I really like it.
","
It's not the fastest charger, but it works perfect for charging while you sleep. It does get a little warm, not hot, just warm, so I put 2 pens under it to let the air circulate. It's nice for travel, it doesn't take up any space and the light is so small, it doesn't keep you awake. The light is blue when charging, green when done, or just on.
","
You would think what could be so hard about plugging in a phone????  Just lazy I guess?  Anyway, this super easy/thin wireless charger is on the nightstand and all you have to do is to just put down your phone and crawl in.  I usually go to be later than my husband, so it's dark and used to forget to plug in my phone all the time.  Now, I just lay it down on the small light and wake up to a fully charged phone in the a.m.!
","
I bought this to go on my bedroom nightstand. Its great however it does have a small ring of light that is green when not charging and blue when it is. I don't like the light at night I like things pitch black so it is annoying to me and that is why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise its great.

Man I can’t get enough of these TOZO products. I bought their T6 wireless earbuds and wow was I impressed. Go check those out. I bought this because the earbuds are wireless charging compatible and am blown away once again. High quality finish and look. Ultra slim and the led lights turn from green to blue when charging. I even tried my phone on it with my lifeproof case and it still charged it. My buddy’s $60 wireless charger couldn’t charge my phone through the case. The led lights are barely lit so there’s no issue at night if your worried about that. TOZO is proving over and over again that price does not reflect the quality of products. I’ll only be buying from them in the future. Go get this. You won’t be disappointed. Thank you TOZO.
","
I love this concept and the simplicity of the device. It's easy to use, though it doesn't always connect to my phone. When it does, the back of my phone gets pretty hot, which can't be too good for it.
","
Nice inexpensive wirrless charger that charges a phone from dead in about 2.5 hours (using an ordinary 2.1A rapid charger base that comes with your phone). I know,, I know, using a cable directly provides the same results but it's nice not to have to plug and unplug a USB-C cable and wear out the port. Also, my phone has NEVER gotten hot while charging. Warning.... the led lights built into it are BRIGHT but just cover then with your phone.
","
This is a great little wireless charger.  It plugs in and just works.  It's small, as indicated in the description.  The photo shows it size relative to my Amazon Echo Buds case.I don't travel with it, but it could be used for travel since it's so compact.I think it's cool looking, but I'm an old man these days and have been told my judgement in that department is a bit dated.
","
I've read that wireless chargers don't charge your phone as fast but I've also read that that isn't the case anymore. Well I have a XS Max that's a few months old and the charging speed with this wireless charger doesn't come close to charging my phone with a wired(?) charger. I haven't used any other wireless chargers so I don't know how the speed compares but this charger's good if you're not actively trying to charge your phone in a short period of time.  However putting the speed aside, it's a very pretty charger. The design is super sleek and looks expensive. If you're going for a modern look, this is definitely the charger you're looking for.
","
You have to have it outside of your cover
","
Great product.  Kinda lame they don’t include a power cord.  But it’s not a big deal.
","
I love the look of this charger and the color change when it’s charging. It works great to wirelessly charge my Raycon earbuds. However it does not work with my iPhone 11 at all. It briefly changes color then stops charging. I bought two of these for different rooms to charge my earbuds but unfortunately docking one star since I can’t charge my phone with it.
","
Bought these as stocking stuffers and added one for myself. I have a Samsung Note 8. It worked great on everyone's phone except mine. I do not know why mine will not charge (even tried my husband's and it wouldn't charge) and other's charged on mine. It actually depleted my battery. Sleek, easy to use. Verizon and Samsung customer service couldn't figure it out either.
","
I have a Pixel 3 which has terrible battery, so even when I start the day with a full battery it's dying before noon.  It's convenient to use this charger wirelessly while I'm working and the lighting at night is kind of calming!  It also helps me see where my water is when I wake up thirsty and don't want any spillage in the village
","
Great charger! I use it with my iPhone X. I got the matte black one because I wanted more grip so my phone wouldn’t fall easily. It does 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁.. but that might be because my house has recently gotten dusty.. correction.. I’ve just now noticed the dust that I’m sure has been here 😂. The only thing I don’t quite like is how 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝘁 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁. I’ve been putting random things in front of it but I’m probably going to put a dab of black nail polish on it eventually.
","
As much as I need a product to function properly, I’m still a sucker for aesthetically pleasing tech. This charger delivers exactly as advertised, and it’s sleek and pretty to boot. It’s not flimsy and has a bit of heft. I use it for my AirPods (with a slim silicone cover) and iPhone (with a slim eLago case).The lights change from green to blue when you’ve placed your device on it properly so you know it’s charging (it flashes green if it's not connected well enough to charge). When it's finished charging, the light changes back to green from blue. I wish the cord was a bit longer, but that was easily remedied with one of a million other cords I had from other products. Would purchase again if I needed another for a different room.

 This is a great charger -- it's super thin and has a large area that will charge your device.  The large charging area is nice as you don't have to find the exact spot where it'll charge.  I rarely have to reposition my phone on this Tozo charger.  I have another one that's around twice as thick, yet the charging area is probably 50% less. There is a single light that indicates the charging status.I've been using it for a around 10 days now with no problems.Great charger for an excellent price!
","
Straight up beige, khaki color, NOT rose gold as advertised. Difficult to find the right placement to confirm charging symbol display, but I've used a Samsung wireless charger as well for my Note 9 and it was the same way so must be a wireless charging thing. Works great just disappointed with the color, should of bought black.
","
This charging port is a lifesaver. My actual charger broke and I bought this to keep in my office but I thought that it looked really cute in my spare bedroom. I will be purchasing more to put in every room so if I have company they’ll have their own short charging port. The only downside you have to make sure that your phone is perfectly centered for it to charge. But I would definitely recommend I love the color I love the fact that it indicates when it is actually charging your phone.
","
I bought this for my office.  This is a very nice and stylish looking charger.  Sure beats the cord hanging on top of the desk or cabinet.  How many times have you pulled out the cord because you forgot to unplug your dang phone, especially in the dark?  I bought a second one for the family room.  The charging light is very bright.  If you have it in a bedroom that is totally blacked out you can cover it .  Another use for duct tape.  Will be buying a couple more .
","
maybe its my case , but sometimes it just doesn't work
","
I decided that a charging pad had to be easier than plugging and and unplugging my phone in every night to charge it - and I was so, so right. This charging pad is great. I just put my phone on top of the charging pad and I'm done. It is so easy. Note that the pad has 2 LED lights on top that change color when the phone is charging. These lights are bright and may be sleep-disturbing depending on where you place the charger at night.
","
I have this charger two stars bc it's definitely cute, slim, and very nice looking. However, it charges veryyyyy slowly if even at all. I was hoping for something appealing to keep on my desk bc my cord didn't reach to well but this ended up being a let down. I gave it a few try's and am now giving up on it. I just had it on there for 30 minutes, it said it was charging, started at 42% and when I came back it was at 40%... All in all it is very aesthetically pleasing but ineffective for actual charging 👎🏼👎🏼
","
I love the sleek look and aesthetic of this charger. It is really smooth and thin without being flimsy or feeling cheap. Instead, it’s sturdy and the rubber grippers on the bottom of the pad make it so it doesn't slide around, so it’s nice and secure while your device is charging on top of it. It feels well made and charges without being finicky or requiring the phone to be perfectly positioned on the pad a certain way, as it connects and charges even if your phone is off-centered or laying at any angle. It’s been so easy and reliable that I really don't ever use my traditional cord to charge up anymore, I just use this charging pad. I highly recommend!

 Being in the market for a wireless charger, I have searched upon pages and pages of them. I found this one and decided to give it a shot because it looked fancy and it matched my Imac setup. Upon arrival, the box was easy to open, with no hassle and instructions were clear as daylight. Simplified, really, you just plug it in the charger, and into a port, boom, done you've done it. LEDs are a nice feature as it tells me if my phone is charging (blue if it is/green if not) and overall it's nice glass finish adds to the already sleek design of this charger. Also, it doesn't heat up as much as I thought as it had consistently remained at a constant low temperature.  10/10 I would buy another.
","
I like the look of these wireless chargers - very sleek, low profile.  If you get one that has the lights on the charging surface it can be a little bright at night.  But if your phone is on the charger the lights change from green to blue and the phone actually covers the lights so it's not bright at all.  I've purchased 3 of these (black, white and blue) for differently charging stations around my house and at work and am very satisfied with them.I have a Spigen Slim Armor CS Designed for Apple iPhone 11 Case with a credit card (with chip) drivers license and insurance card inside the case and the charger works just fine through this case with the cards inside.  I highly recommend this product.
","
Easy to use, convenient.. works well.
","
The design is nice and sleek and it’s obviously simple to use. Place phone on charger, it charges. Take it off, phone stops charging.It works through my phone case, which is excellent.My only complaint is that this charger has a green light that’s always on when your phone isn’t charging. I don’t want to have to unplug it every single time I’m not using my phone, because that kind of defeats the purpose of wireless charging. I haven’t found a way to turn that off without unplugging it, so if anyone knows, please let me know!When the phone charges, the wireless charger has a blue light.
","
I lost my previous wireless charger I've used for 3 years while traveling. I picked this one up because it was cheaper. I do notice is is slightly slower in charging, as well as has a stricter radius for the phone to lay on in order to charge. Good charger to have phone sit on overnight, but is not comparable to corded option for quick charging.
","
It works, that’s all I have to say about it. It doesn’t charge well, it doesn’t charge fast.
","
I have a regular old PopSocket nothing fancy, magnetic or metal just plain plastic so when I found out it charges through my PopSocket and case I knew it was a 5 star product!
","
Quality of the charger is terrible. I have no idea what everyone's talking about but I have a Samsung Galaxy S9 and the charging only works is if it's turned off or you're not using at all. Even then it charges super slow.
","
Bought 1 and then came back and bought another!  Good charger for phones!!
","
This product is good and very easy to use!
","
for the price, this item is awesome
","
I got this to replace the Google charging stand that I bought for my Pixel 3 XL, which did not work very well  The TOZO charger is amazing!  First of all it looks really cool - it's thin and very sleek looking.  It charges my phone reliably every time.  I absolutely love the LED lighting - it gives a very clear indication when the phone is charging, by switching from green to blue, and goes back to green when the phone is completely charged.  The best part is that it's not too bright.  I'm a pretty sensitive sleeper, and usually I have to cover up the indicators on a charger like this with gaffer's tape.  WIth the TOZO it was fine just as is.  I am very glad I bought this one - thanks TOZO!
","
I have had this charger for less than a week. It appears to be charging adequately and is on par with a Samsung charger we use. I like that it’s sleek yet solid. The blue one I received only has a green/blue indicator on the side of the unit. It is not terribly obtrusive. The photos that show the pad lighting up does not apply to this one as there is a rubber pad on top that’s not transparent. What more is there to say...it’s a charger. I can’t speak to it’s longevity but hope it lasts at least a couple of years. Who knows by then there may exist a new charging solution for our smartphones.
","
I liked the idea of a wireless charger for my bedside table, but I wish I had known that there is an LED light on ALL THE TIME!  It's a little too bright for me as I like my room to be really dark when I'm trying to sleep.  Otherwise, it's nice looking and charges my phone well.
","
Very sleek & works easily, just weird it doesn't fast charge my phone. I use a fast charging adapter. My phone says it ""isn't compatible with wireless fast charging"" even though it works just fine fast charging on my husband's wireless fast charger.
","
I got this for a dear friend at work for Christmas who does so many things for me that I do not have the knowledge for and does not charge me a penny. I decided since she got a new iPhone 11 I would get her this can’t thing! I wanted something with weight so it didn’t deal cheap and it passed the test! It works flawlessly even with her otter box with the built in pop socket! I’m ecstatic she is happy and I know it is a usable gift that she can use for a very long time if taken care of, and every time she uses it she has a cool reminder that that awesome coworker gave her a useful gift nobody had gotten her that won’t be stored in a drawer some where!
","
Works,  but you will have to remove phone from the case to use.  At least in my case it did.Cannot charge without it being plugged in though. Was hoping I could move it around,  but it does need to be plugged in to charge your phone.Works as described.
","
I like the product it feels solid.  It charges well and have had no issues since I have been using it.  The light is green when on and blue when charging.  I am uncertain it stops charging at 100% because the light does not change back to green and my phone always says charging once it reaches 100%.  So I just never let it get to 100% and use it randomly throughout the day.  All in all it is a solid well constructed charger that I am satisfied with.
","
This is not a bad charger at all for the price seeing I paid $130.00 for a wireless charger from the Apple store in 2020, this one so far works no different so as long as it lasts money well spent.
","
I have an iPhone 12 in a fairly thin case. I was worried that the case would keep the charger from working but when I put my phone close to the charger (i.e. 1/4 inch), it actually jumped up and attached to the phone and started charging. I especially am appreciative of the USB adaptor since I have older chargers along with a new one. I really like just sitting my phone on it rather than having to plug it in and unplug it during the day.
","
This charger replaced a charger from another company that didn’t perform well.  Whenever I used the old charger, I had to hunt for the exact spot that would start the charging procedure.  The Tozo connects every time on the first try with different devices.  It also looks better than the charger it replaced.
","
Received my new wireless charger, (my 1st one by the way). Took it right out of the package and connected it to my USB wall charger with the supplied charger cord. It lit up instantly and when I sat my earbuds on the charger while inside the case it started charging immediately. I'm very happy with this purchase I think I will purchase an additional charger to have at work to avoid having to take the charger back and forth. All in all, very satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely recommend.
","
I ordered these a while ago from amazon because they looked so cool and were selling at a very reasonable price.  I actually bought two for myself and another for my girlfriend because she liked mine so much.  I ended up not being satisfied with them and upon hearing this, Tozo reached out to me and offered to replace both of my wireless chargers.  I really appreciate this kind of customer service follow up and I would not hesitate to buy from Tozo.Also, one nice thing that I was unaware of when I clicked ""buy"" is that these are USB-C compatible which is a huge plus!  I actually love these now!
","
Looks nice and modern but charges pretty slowStill like it tho
","
I just got the iPhone 12 and new charger.  I love the concept but if the phone isn't positioned perfectly on the charger, it will not charge.  Also, if the phone is unlocked, it will not charge.  I use my bluetooth all the time and placing the phone on the charger during a call is pointless.  Or in the dark.
","
Update:The company reached out to me and offered a few options to remedy this problem. I am impressed by their willingness to help when they could have easily let it go.This is the third morning in a row (I received it 3 days ago) I've woken up to my phone being dead despite it sitting on the charger all night ""charging"".It's a beautiful charger that is slim and easy to travel with. It looks wonderful on my shelves.
","
The charging power is not really there, but then for the price what can you say. I remember when wireless chargers came out there were pushing 80$. The pad is super thin and lights up two different colors depending if you are charging or not. The light stays on regardless of charging or not.
","
I purchased this with my new earbuds.  I like it.  It's so easy to just toss my case on this to charge them.  I wish my phone's case allowed me to use it as well because it's handy.  I keep it in the living room where I usually have my earbuds anyway and it is unobtrusive. While I bought it for my earbuds, I was in the living room and my phone was about to die, so I pulled the case off to charge my phone.  I have an iPhone Xr.  It took about 5 hours to charge from 5% to 100%.  Overall I'm happy with this purchase.  No complaints.
","
I got the pink one and I truly love how cute and sleek it is. I've never used a wireless charger before and bought these along with a pair of wireless earbuds from the same company to use with. It's super convenient and I was able to just plop my iphone 8 onto it and it started charging instantly. The charging rate is pretty good, similar to a regular Iphone charger, but it doesn't charge nearly as fast as the Ipad charger I use daily lol, but that's something I already expected.
","
Works well and I like the colors that show when it's charging, complete, etc. But it is NOT a high powered (fast) charger. Takes 4-6 hours to charge up our phones. So workers fine as an overnight charger...
","
Feels and looks like a quality product, the display charging lights are quite nice as well as informative if your device is charging or not
","
The device works great with my iPhone.  It’s easy to use and charges quickly. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I know it will be great for travel.
","
This makes it much easier to simply place my phone on the charger. We bought one for home and one for the cottage.
","
I was really skeptical about buying this little charger, but I needed one ASAP. The reviews looked good so I took a chance. This little guy is sleek, very easy to use, and perfect for the ""Technically Challenged"" individuals like myself. You know immediately if it's ready by the Green Light. The light turns Blue when it's charging and Turquoise if your phone needs to be adjusted. This would make a great stocking stuffer for the upcoming holidays. I plan on buying two more for different spots in my house so I don't have to drag it from room to room. Just trust me guys...Get It!
","
Paired this pad with an Anker 18w charging brick and it works wonderfully. Super slim, it almost blends into the table and I like the LED’s changing from green (not charging) to blue (charging) so I know it actually is charging and then changing back again so I know when it’s done without having to touch the phone.Words of caution though: when there isn’t a phone on the charging pad the green LED lights remain on. And they are bright. My phone is always covering them at night otherwise it would likely interfere with my sleep.
","
This product does exactly what it says it does,  my only issue is how bright the lights on it are.  Took me a while to get used to the bright lights in the bedroom when I was trying to sleep but I'm kind of crazy about light while trying to sleep so it's probably not that bad for most people.
","
It’s so slim and clean looking.  I ordered one for my husband and one for myself.  I highly recommend these.  They charge through our phone cases just fine.
","
I have had many times where the phone was not charging all night because it was not in the perfect place, so it can be annoying, and you are not wireless with the charger itself it has to be plugged in, i thought it was wireless and charged wirelessly, yes you can set phone on it and it will charge the phone if you have it in the right place, overall, its ok.
","
Looks and works great.
","
Overall its a great product. I just wish It was stronger and charged your phone faster. I can not charge it without having to take my case off to do so. And as far as it charging faster I might just be use to my lightning charger but I just wish it was as fast as it.
","
I really like this wireless charger. I haven't used a wireless charger before so for a first one, it's really nice. I did have to take my case off to use it but I still like it.
","
I put this device next to my desktop keyboard that I can charge my phone easily, and I just push it away when I am not using it. It is slim in size, easy to use, and inexpensive. Charging my phone without plug in the USB-C cable and unplug it later makes my life much easier. I am glad that I purchaed this little guy.
","
Wireless charger, truly, seems to work well thus far. Have had for a couple weeks. Charged iPhone 11 fairly quickly. Only complaint thus far is that the chord is not very long and it only comes with USB, does not come with an adapter for the wall plug in.
","
I really love this charger. I bought it specifically for the appearance of it because I am using it for my desk. I don’t plan on traveling with it but who knows after quarantine is over. I was surprised with how thin the charger was. It’s extremely lightweight and I can see this as a perfect charger for traveling. If anyone is looking for an aesthetically pleasing charger while being portable friendly then go forth and get this one. Also the light being on the side is extremely helpful since it won’t bother you while you sleep.
","
So I bought this really excited to do some automation with Tasker using the wireless charging events. To my dismay (and embarrassment) my phone doesn't feature wireless charging 🤦 luckily I have a set of Bluetooth earbuds that do have wireless charging so it wasn't a total waste (I say, totally not trying to justify...)At any rate, build quality is great, it's super slim and quite shiny and the LEDs, even though they're blue, are not bright enough (to me) to be bothersome in a dark room.

 overall high powered quality charger. It works with all types of phones and products that use wireless charging technology from phones to headphones. In the product description it mentions the iphone 12 and makes you feel that may not work with other phones – It does have a powerful magnet that fixes itself to the 12 as well as charge. But the charging feature works well with all products that I have in my home minus my apple watch.
","
This wireless charger exceeds my expectations and charges my iPhone 11 faster than any other wireless charger I have bought. It has a very high quality finish on it, which gives the charger a professional look for business or office use. I won’t be going anywhere without this wireless charger. If you have a case on your phone, this charger will charge your phone without any problem. I definitely recommend this wireless charger product to anyone who wants their electronics charged up fast and can take with them wherever they go!
","
The charger looks really sleek and modern, but it can be finicky. Sometimes it would charge my iPhone 12, sometimes it wouldn’t. It works really well plugged into the USB port on my PC, but it did not work well when plugged into the wall. It is not a super fast charger, but for the price it’s not bad
","
No permite carga rapida
","
It is much more sleek than I thought it would be - great for saving space!It works great on my iPhone X. The only thing I did not realize when making the purchase is that it comes with USB C charging cable, so I had to buy a separate adapter for it, since I did not have one. But, that seems to be the direction things are heading, so it was probably a long overdue investment to get one of these.I have used Tozo products before, and have had a good experience with them all!
","
Makes charging easier! Bought for my boyfriend who’s charging port doesn’t work anymore and it’s perfect!
","
I bought this for my son in law. It works well, but the phone must first be removed from its case, which has a magnet for connecting it to a car mount. Neither of us thought about this as a problem, but while in the case the phone does not charge. So if you don't have this kind of case, I'm sure you'll be pleased.
","
I got this for my grandson and it didn't charge his phone I tried it with mine, still didn't work
","
If you are looking for a charger that is simple and fast, this is the way to go. We were in the process of moving and all of our previous chargers were packed away by the movers.  So we ordered this for our temporary housing and now that we have a permanent location this has become our ""go to"" charger!
","
I have this charger for myself. I visited my family and they used it daily. I purchased this as a gift for them and I know they’re just going to love it. I’ve had mine for over two years and haven’t had any problems. The price is right!!  You can’t go wrong by purchasing this item.

me encanto recarga todo super

This is exactly what I was looking for!! I needed a slim wireless charging pad to use next to my bed; the wireless charger I used previously had such a bright light it was distracting when I tried to sleep at night. This one is perfect, it’s bright enough to see that’s it’s charger in daylight but not so obnoxiously bright at night. It’s great for travel and hardly takes up any space. It looks beautiful and classy but was so affordable. I definitely recommend it!!

Purchased last June to charge our Bluetooth earbuds and SE iPhones. While charger worked great, about a month ago, it was only partially charging. TOZO is known for their reliability and support for their products, which was definitely the case for us. I contacted their customer service, explained our situation and, they immediately agreed to ship out a replacement charger at no cost. A painless experience all the way around. I wouldn't hesitate to buy any TOZO item in future. Very satisfied.
","
I love this charger.  Thin and compact for traveling.  Charges well.
","
Extremely stylish. Love the low profile and the change of color to know when it is actively charging. Had some trouble with the first charger only working a short time but the company was very nice when we contacted them and they sent out a replacement right away.
","
Beautiful upon unboxing. No charging block provided,  just a USB-C cable. Plug in and you'll see the very tiny LED light letting you know it's getting juice. Laid my phone on it and the wireless charging icon lit up on my phone.Beautiful product,  convenient to use (no plugging your phone in), works as expected (but if you want 'fast charging you'll probably need to use the charger that came with your phone)  charges anything equipped for wireless charging (ear buds, for example).
","
Although it claims that it's a fast charging pad, but it's not for me. It takes forever to charge my new Samsung Zflip3.
","
This product has a premium look and feel that allows it to blend seamlessly even in a designer room.  I haven't found any other wireless chargers that look this good and perform this well.I was initially concerned that the ""Aviation Aluminum"" would scratch the glass on my Pixel 3 XL.  I've tested and the answer is ""No.""  Thankfully the metal ring - which does touch the back of the phone - is soft enough to prevent scratching the phone's glass back.One tiny downside of the premium materials: Surface must be flat, otherwise phone will slide off (a case would likely prevent this).
","
I just drop my unit onto the charger, no wires to fuss with. It charges my earbuds very quickly.  Unobtrusive, sits on the desk (generally under a pile of papers) always ready to be used.  There is no adapter but I have mine plugged in to a USB port of which there are many to choose from these days, almost all appliances and wall sockets have a USB connector
","
Good price just need longer cord
","
Great charger and delivered on time.
","
I use this on my bedside to charge my phone overnight. It doesn’t seem particularly fast, but I can’t swear to that. I do know it doesn’t always charge because I was off center by a half inch or so. Mostly does a decent job charging my iPhone overnight though, so I would probably buy it again

Nice quality materials. Paired with a nillkintech short cable version receiver and Google Pixel 3a xl.Also used the charger with Samsung S9 Pro which has wireless charger capability integrated. Both worked fine.The black version does not have the side lights like the other colors, or at least mine did not. I am fine with that!Have not tried high power charging, and not sure I need it.  Seems the best application for this is an office desk or bedside nightstand.

This charging pad has been perfoming great. It works even with the case on my phone. I use the charging plug in that came with my phone which charges faster. The pad does not come with that part. This is an update on September 2, 2021. The charging pad is still performing great. What I didn't mention in my first review is the fact that this charging pad charged my son's iPhone with it's case on it. The charging pad he had required him to take it out of the case.
","
This has 2 LED lights on top to indicate power/charging, while the newer model has a single light on the front. This one is way better because the new one is WAY too bright, literally blindingly so, and shoots directly into your face when the charger is on a desk or night stand. Get this one instead!
","
I ordered two of these and am impressed by the build quality and style.  Of course, the iPhone 11 Max will charge faster with its supplied cable and power supply, but wireless charging is easy and not disruptive... you're not fishing around for cables... not using your phone?  Set it down on top of the charger.  Wireless charging makes keeping your phone topped up easy ... but if it gets away from you and you need a quick charge, you'll want to use the 18 watt rapid charger.  This isn't a limitation on the wireless charger -- the iPhone can't take more than 7.5 watts of power on wireless.Regardless of the limitations (which are Apple's design), this is a great product.  It's stylish, inexpensive and works well ... if your expectations are realistic.
","
This is wonderful. I have a thing on the back if my phone that holds cards. So it makes it extremely difficult to charge ona standing charger. I also didn't know if it would allow it to charge. I was pleasantly surprised that it did. My husband liked mine so much that not only did I buy one for him but one for my son as well. They both live them. Easy to take with as they are so flat. Just git into anywhere!

The TOZO W1 wireless charger has become my new daily companion. I got 2 of them - on for my office desk and the other one to keep with me as I travel between different facilities where I consult. It takes up no space in my bag, and when I get to my work area, it plugs into any nearby USB to keep my phone at optimum charge throughout the day. I am planning to order these for everyone on my holiday gift lists in the future.
","
It is perfect even when you are using a big cover it work. Recomended
","
I purchased this because my phone hasn't been charging with cables lately and wanted to try wireless charging and I'm glad I did. I can now pick up my phone without having to pull a cord or find my cord to charge it anymore. I simply just place it over the wireless charger and instant charging. The design is amazing, it has that futuristic style to it that other wireless chargers don't give. I recommend buying this if your in need of a wireless charger or feel like trying something new like I did.
","
Nice charger however it is not compatible with the newest Samsung Flip 4 and Fold 4.  When placed on the pad it initially says ""Fast Wireless Charging "" but quickly changes to just ""Wireless Charging "" with a system ui pop-up that states this charger is not compatible. Charges these devices no faster than the cheapest charging puck connected to the cheapest wall brick.Tried it with a Samsung brick as well as a QC 3.0 device.
","
The TOZO W1 Wireless Charger is well built and beautiful. It has a nice glossy surface and compliments the other accessories on my desk very well. I particularly like the green and blue lights on the surface - green immediately switches to blue when I place my phone. It does take a few hours to charge, but no complaints there, I just place my phone on it when I am not using it. My tiny gripe is that an AC adapter is not included. I would have gladly purchased a TOZO product that had a bundled in AC adapter.
","
I like this charging pad but the only thing is that it gets warm.
","
Its a good charging pad. I like the ease of using them at home or work. Its uses a usb c connector and does not come with the charging box but still a good product. The lighting on the pad changes color to blue when charging which is helpful to know if it is or not.
","
I have a credit card case on my phone so I was not able to find a charging pad that would work. I happened to see this one on a coworkers desk and put my phone down just to see if it worked. I was shocked when it started charging. I ordered mine on amazon and was glad they had multiple colors to pick from.  My case holds 2 credit cards and my drivers license and this charging pad is able to charge through all 3 with no problem. Very pleased !!
","
I love this thing cause its so practical, super classy and nice and does charge but i've had a couple nights (2 or 3) where I wake up and the phone did not charge at all. not sure though if i didnt place it properly (if its that specific to charge) or if it was my error. just make sure it turns blue when placing the phone. great gift
","
Slim design!! sturdy materials!! and the lights on it light up your phone without lighting up your room. Not to mention- REALLY fast charging when paired with the correct adaptor. My iPhone 11Pro charges so quick I don’t even miss the cable charger my kids keep stealing. 😁The best part- it’s so easy to get the charge pad to recognize my phone and charge it without either cooking it or just dropping the charge instead!!  Great job making this one!! Super happy with this purchase!!!  The best one out there!!  I’ve gone thru 5 looking for something like this one. The heavier weight keeps it in place, yet slim enough to to stash in your bag!!What could make this better?  If they sold the wall adapter with it!!
","
This works great for our family charging our phones.
","
I wanted to get a wireless charger for my earbuds.  My old QI charger by my bed is not compatible, so I got this one for my office.  Just set the earbud case on top- voila!  Works great.  This also charges my Samsung S9 phone nicely, so now I can charge my phone in twwo places.This unit is also surprisingly compact; MIUCH smaller than my old wireless charger - this is only 2-1/4 inches in diameter and less than a 1/4 inch thick.  Feels solid too!
","
I was so impressed with everything about my TOZO T10 Earbuds purchase, I did not hesitate to order their Wireless Charge.  The charger is black and has an USB cable for charging it.  I immediately hooked the charger up to charge it and placed my T10 Earbuds in their case on the charger for charging.  So far I'm equally impressed with this charger.  IF there are any problems, I will update my review.  For now it's all thumbs up!
","
Exactly what I expected/needed but cheaper than the options straight from Amazon or Peel.  Wanted an option that allowed me to simply place my phone down at my desk to charge without having to keep taking plug in and out every time I picked phone up.  This is very slim, not slippery or slidey, non intrusive but functional.  The only thing to be aware of is that you need your own brick (the little white box that plugs in to the outlet) to attack the USB into.
","
Perfect for a household with apple and android users. Love that the light changes colors to tell you it’s charging, takes the guess work out.
","
I really love the look of this charging pad. It's very sleek and attractive to have out where it can be seen. So far I haven't had any issues with using it, it's a very simple plug it in and put your phone on it kind of thing. It changes from green to blue when it's charging, and it has the auto shut off when your phone is charged. It does seem to take longer to charge via the charging pad than when I plug it in but it's not a huge issue for me as I'm usually letting it charge in the evenings. The only drawback is that it's a little bright at night since it's right by my bed. I put a tissue box over it when I go to bed. :-)
","
I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max, this charger takes so long to position the phone on that I might as well just plug it in.  It only charges when the phone is perfectly aligned.  Usually quits charging before the phone is fully charged.  Mine is going in the bin after 4 months.
","
Top is soft and light mauve in color. Not shiny like edges. Phone charger that came with device is more efficient however wireless works good enough for nightly charging. I had a magnet attached to the back of my phone for car mount that disabled wireless charging.  Magnet had to be removed to get wireless charging to work.
","
I purchased the ""champagne"" color and was expecting a nice soft gold. I should have paid more attention to the photos because it's actually a matte rubber top in an ugly tan color. The bottom of it is a pretty champagne gold, but that doesn't do much when it's sitting on a table and you can't see that part... I returned it for the rose gold that says it has a hard resin top, so we'll see...
","
Liked it so much, I’m going to purchase a couple more!
","
This is my first wireless charger.  I ended up grabbing it since I also purchased the Tozo T6 wireless earbuds and didn't feel like plugging them in to charge the battery.  I also have an iPhone 8 Plus and it works like a charm with the W1.  Just make sure you get a wall socket adapter to ensure the W1 has the proper amount of power feeding to it for phone charging.Be aware that this isn't going to charge your phone as fast as plugging it into a wall socket power, but it's still pretty reasonable if you're not in a rush.  I got the Anker Quick Charge 3.0, 18W 3Amp USB Wall Charger.
","
Originally gave 2 stars - It was working fine the first couple weeks and then all of a sudden it stopped charging. I moved my phone any which way possible to get the light to turn green and charge but nothing happens.Update from my above review, now 5 stars: just contacted them through their customer service email above the issue, and they’ll be sending me a new one free. Hopefully this one won’t have any issues. Nice and speedy customer service!
","
The wire for dad’s phone was always behind his desk. Not anymore. His phone is charged fast too.
","
This charger is a dream, it looks SO sleek and doesn't have the logo anywhere in sight so it looks very modern and futuristic. It has two green light lines when idle and two blue light lines when charging. It charges fast and is such great quality. The set up was fantastically easy and just uses one cord to plug in. You don't have to deal with any breaking cords and it is perfect to charge my phone while I'm working at my desk or sleeping.
","
I love having super tech friendly devices and ones that also stand out. This one stands out but does take a while to charge your device, and if you're always on your phone, this is not the charger for you. If you take a break from your phone for about an hour or two then I would recommend this product.
","
It's a great change of pace being able to set the phone on my night stand instead of searching for the cord every night to plug in. It changes from green to blue when it begins charging so you know it's aligned properly. The green light is actually bright enough at night when the phone is not on top of the charging puck to act as a dim night light.
","
Doesn't charge from a port on a 2019 MacBook Pro -> iPhone 13 Max
","
Sleek and well made. Works as intended.
","
Love this! Super chic and aesthetically pleasing. My favorite wireless charger I’ve owned.Edit: It stopped working after a few weeks. I could not get my phone to charge. It would just flash green no matter how I positioned it. I contacted the company and they are sending me another one. Customer service is wonderful! I will say that. Hopefully my replacement works and continues to do so.
","
It’s really good and a step up from my old wireless charger, but sometimes it will randomly stop charging, even when the phone is perfectly positioned and hasn’t been moved. I would say 8/10 times it works perfectly, but can be frustrating waking up to an uncharged phone.
","
More than half the time, phone won't charge when placed on charging pad. Cycling power to the pad fixes it. Annoying.Edit: Tozo reached out and replaced it with a W3, no issues with that device.
","
Small, easy to use with my wireless earbuds! I just sit the earbuds case right on it, and charges right up, pretty quickly. I am happy I invested in this when I got the earbuds...I wasn't looking to get an extra charging item since you can plug the case in, but this is simple and quick, no fighting with small ended cords to get into the case. I would def recommend this item. Much cleaner and neater when it comes to charging things, as well as a lot faster. :)Price was great, packaging was quite impressive for a little item, and shipping was quick.
","
It's working good with both my Samsung s22 and Tozo earbuds
","
I own several of the original series of the Tozo wireless chargers all of our vehicles have one in them they are great. When I saw the sleek new design I wanted to upgrade as it would look nicer on my night stand. It charges fast and look great but the status light that used to come on a for a few seconds then fade out on the older models has been replaced with a constant green glow that turns blue while charging. So there is always a light of some kind on which makes it impractical for a night stand.
","
CONS:This product is not compatible with an apple charging port. The led indicators on the product are supposed to light up green when a device is ready to be charged using the wireless charger, but the included directions do not specify this. The led indicators turn blue when a device is being charged; the directions do not specify this either. As someone that has little experience with wireless charging it was very confusing for me to understand how this product worked, especially before discovering an apple charging port is not compatible with it.PROS:Love the color options and the sleek design.
","
I really like this charger. its super thin, works very well and charges decentally fast. while it doesnt support ""fast charging"" up to par with samsung standards, it still charges quickly enough for a wireless charger. Gets me through my work day when my phone is dead, i put on the charger for 10 minutes when it get to like 10% and i can use it for 20-30 before it getsto 15% again. The original one didn't barley work at all, and they replaced in in less than a week between receiving the first and getting the replacement.
","
I bought this charger because I was tired of buying the Apple charge cords and having them wear out or fail to connect. This charger plugs into a standard USB charger block. One then places the iPhone on top. Once the green lights turn blue, the phone is charging. Easy as that. While one could use it in their car, I am not sure that CarPlay would be enabled since it only charges the battery. That aside, it does everything I wanted it to do.
","
This charger is light weight but more importantly super fast.  It has been great with both iPhone and android.
","
For some reason this started working properly!  Good inexpensive charger
","
It looks slim and cool.
","
Easy to use. Works great!
","
Update: this charger is fantastic. The trick is, you need to use a 2A power adapter. If you use a 1A adapter, the connection will be shotty and might not reach through your case. I emailed customer service to discover this. They were fantastic and helped me realize my problem quickly. I am going to leave this review at 2 stars so people will read it. Moral of the story: Buy this and get a 2A power adapter for it.Old review: This charger looks fantastic. The problem is, it struggles..... If you have any type of case on your phone, even a thin one, the charger won't work. If your phone is bumped out of position, the charger won't work. It is extremely finicky. It is really annoying to wake up in the morning and discover that the phone you carefully placed and adjusted the night before, never charged. (My phone case is very simple and extremely thin. My wife's phone has the same issues on this charger)I have (tried to) use this product every night for the past two months. I am going to go buy something else now.
","
I got this for my 80 year old father.  He no longer needs to fumble trying to plug in the usb cable.  He is happy to wake up to a fully charged phone each morning.  The blue light lets him know he has placed the phone properly on the charging base.
","
Really sleek design, very pretty, delicate (glass face) and comes with a weird charger. Not lighting speed charging but it’s good if you just want to let your phone rest for a bit. Not a fast charging device. Make sure the color Blue is visible or your phone isn’t charging. I really like it!
","
I love wireless chargers but having to place my phone in just the right spot on the charger is irritating.  As is, when the phone lying on the charger I really can't use it.  In comes TOZO!!!  This is a great little charger about the size of a silver dollar and as thick as a Hershey bar!  Holds firm even with the phone in a protective case.  AND unlike the iPhone 12, this charger comes with a USB to USB-C adapter!  May order another one soon.
","
It works it’s fine but I hear. High pitched beeping when I’m around it my husband doesn’t. So just beware if your ears pick up on everything!
","
Does what I expected easy to use connects no problem not super fast but perfect for overnight charger
","
I loved this so much I bought one for upstairs and downstairs both. The only trick is to make sure you have the phone squarely on the sensor. I have woken up a couple times to a phone that had not charged overnight.
","
This is just a first impression review.  I cannot attest to longevity.  So far, this has been able to connect to my phone through an Otterbox case, a card pocket and a driver's license.  I had another from another manufacturer that when I put my phone on it I had to search for the sweet spot for it to charge.  I can out my phone right on the Tozo wireless charger and it just starts charging.  I also have a pair of totally wireless ear buds that I can place the case on it and that starts charging right away.I will have to update when I have had this longer.
","
It's working fine as a wireless charger, but I had two problems with it. First, it's not easy to use. You can't just put your phone on it; instead, you need to adjust your phone to a certain position and angle in order to get charged. I don't know how many times when I woke up in the morning, the phone is not charged because it's not oriented in the required direction. The weirdest thing is that I specifically made sure the phone started charging before going to sleep. If I had to make so much effort to charge my phone wireless, I might as well just plug it in - it'll just take less than a second. The second issue I have with it is that the charging is way less efficient than using a cable. If I need to charge my phone for an emergency, I can't count on the wireless charger.
","
It's takes a long time to charge
","
Updated Review: I recently left a really bad review because I thought my delivered product was scratched but turns out it had a very thin removable plastic layer that was on there so well that it didn't look like it was supposed to come off, I managed to peel it off revealing a pristine white surface, looks amazing. Now the only reason Im giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because Im pretty sure I selected Gold at checkout but instead received Silver to go with my Gold iPhone 11 Pro, and it came a day late through Prime...1st world problems, what a time we live in.
","
I initially got this charger for myself at work, but just out of curiosity I hooked it up at home to see if it would work with my wife's phone (which has a case and popsocket). To my surprise, it worked! The phone does have to be fairly close to centered, but it successfully charges through the socket and case. That said, it now rests on her nightstand so she doesn't have to use her charging cable.10/10 product
","
Know quite sure if I didn’t read the product deets in its entirety, but I thought this was completely wireless...I thought you simply had to charge the unit, and once it was fully charged, you could move it anywhere and be truly wireless..So Not the case!! It must be plugged it at all times!A bit disappointed on that part but still a very sleek design..
","
I have a iphone 11, smartish 4 card case and a Lamicall finger ring stand (stuck at the very bottom of the case) and this little charger works with it all!! I'm so happy it works with it.I do absolutely hate that the lights are so bright and don't turn off though!! Why not have them auto off after 15 seconds and put a TINY indicator light on the side or in an inconspicuous place??? That's my only annoyance because I use it to charge my phone by my bed and have to hide it behind my water bottle or something else.I just take a regular cord for traveling because it's easier for me.
","
es lindo. practico. pero la carga es un poco lenta.
","
Works great with my iPhone 11 Pro Max! I haven't tried the fast charging function yet, but I love that it has the capability to. It's a very beautiful product, and feels and looks expensive.My only complaint that I've seen some other reviewers discuss is that there is always a light on; the green light stays on until you put a phone on it, and then the blue light stays on all night while it's charging. The lights aren't necessarily bright IMO (maybe gives off the same light as a digital alarm clock?) and it doesn't bother me, but if you are sensitive to light while you're sleeping, I might recommend looking at a different product.That being said, this charger works perfect for me. I definitely prefer it to other wireless chargers I've purchased! :-)
","
It came when it was supposed to and worked properly
","
Doesn’t charge fast at all. You can have your phone on for an hour and it’ll charge maybe 5 percent. It’s okay if you want to use overnight but they get your phone hot too. Value for money isn’t bad at all and it’ll charge fully overnight but just not what I expected.
","
I bought this wireless charger as it is easier for my kids to use to charge their wireless devices.  They mess up the charging ports having to mess with cables.  The device includes a USB cable and has a faint green glow to show it is powered on which turns blue once a device has been set on it.  It chargers my Tozo wireless headphones, iPhones, Pixels, etc.  The build quality of the charger matches the quality and build of Apple devices and looks like something Apple would make for their devices without the high price they would probably charge the consumer.  The only suggestion is to build a smaller charger so it takes up less desk space, but overall looks and works great charging my devices.
","
Product is very nice looking and low profile. Seems to be quite good quality and works better than the stand-up charger from another manufacturer, which I recently returned. The lights are pleasing and intuitive so that you know charging status. Power output is likely based on the brick, which you supply). I used the original Samsung brick and it seems to charge at a reasonable speed.... not as fast as some other chargers I have but I think that may be better for overall battery life.
","
I got this so that I could charge my phone whenever I set it down at my desk. No fumbling with plugging in or unplugging to take my phone somewhere.The design of this charger is sleek too and the color indication makes it easy to tell if it's not lined up right.The charging power seems great too, I like to have some games run on my phone when I set it down and it's able to supply enough power so it's always going.
","
The LED indicators can be a little bright at night (personally speaking) but this charger works fine. Got it for my mom as a gift and she uses it everyday. Very easy to use, feels solid, and comes in several colors. Only the rim has color, but it is a nice accent.
","
This product... I bought it because it looked nice and it wouldn't look bad on my desk while I work, so I could charge my phone while I work on my laptop. Overall this product works as it should, charges my phone and is super slick and great for traveling. The reason I gave it a 4 star on Easy to Use is because sometimes it's hard to find that perfect spot where you need to have it for it to charge. BUT that does NOT mean its a bad product. It works great and I would buy again!
","
I like the look. It’s nicer than the cheap plastic. The only problem I had is that sometimes it will not charge when the phone is fully dead. Sometimes it does. Also the charging takes awhile. I was hoping it was going to charge faster than the regular cord
","
UPDATED TO 4 Stars: after my OtterBox case broke I switched to a different style case and decided to give this another try. I am now getting great results with this charger. it charges quickly and hasn't given me trouble since the switch!If you use a case, this thing won't charge your phone. I can get a slow charge when I take the case off, but taking it on and off every night to charge is not practical. Works well for charging wireless headphones but that's about it. It does NOT charge quickly.
","
It does charge my phone but it is super slow at doing so.
","
Looks great too!This is my first wireless charger and it does exactly what I would expect it to do. I put my phone down on it and the lights turn from green to blue and the phone starts charging.I have a LifeProof case with a rim that causes some extra space between the back of the phone and the surface, but fortunately this does not seem to be an issue.The only minor complaint is that if I don't put the phone close to the center of the charger it will not start charging. I suppose this would be true of any wireless charger and easily noticeable by the LED lights not switching to blue. So not a big deal.Looks great and does what it's supposed to do with ease. Five stars.
","
I loved everything about it
","
works as described
","
Really nice looking charger, it arrived with scuffs on the surface where a phone lies for charging, it’s supposed to be new so I assume they sent me a return or something other than a new charger. It took two hours to charge 40% of my iPhone battery. And they buy 5 star reviews with promises of another free charger. I chose to return it.
","
It was an ok product while it lasted. I received it as a gift to charge my iPhone. It worked out for a while but I had to be very particular when placing my phone on it to align and charge. I did have the magnetic attachment on the back of my phone, but even after removing that it wasn’t working at some point. I know it is more difficult to charge with the attachment on the back, but I had taken that into account. I don’t know if that had anything to do with the charger not working anymore, but if that’s the case then that should probably be stated somewhere.
","
Sleek an easy to use
","
I have to say I love the idea of the wireless charging, but I found that in a lot of instances, when I place my phone on the wireless charging unit, it initially charges. If I walk away and come back later, it may or may not have charged. There is a position that the phone needs to be in and then a certain spot on the charger for it to charge correctly. I have found myself manually charging my phone with the lightning cable instead. I also notice that it charges slowly, but that may be the manufacture’s intended charging speed.
","
Sleek looks, works great with my galaxy S8 plus in a case with a pop socket on the back. My only complaint is that while charging, the lights flash between 2 colors so if it's on your nightstand, it will be a bit distracting while you sleep.
","
Charging pad did not work. It would immediately drop the connection from my phone or the battery percentage would stay the same even when it has been charging for 1 hour+. I reached out to TOZO and they said they would send me a replacement. Customer service is great! Will update this review when the new charging pad comes.
","
I bought this wireless charger originally to charge my headphones and it does great with that. I am disappointed though that it does not charge my phone with or without the case. That's why it's four and not five stars
","
the product is an OK product. easy to use. works as intended. well build product. but is not a product for quick charging because its slow as charging. been charging huawei P30 pro on it and it charges just fine. its has a light on it it to indicate that its charging. one down side about it is that the phone has to be in the center to charge
","
Product is small and thin which makes it easy for placement around the house.  Works quickly on my Note 10 Plus.  I've not used it in the car as of yet but it should function just as well - if it doesn't, I'll get back.  Overall, very satisfied customer.
","
Perfect small charger, and like the indicator light
","
I love this charger I put it by my bedside table so that way I can charge my phone. The only downside is you have to place your phone correctly on it or it won’t charge. Another downside is when you want to be on your phone in your bed you can’t because you have to place the phone on the charger. You  can’t just hold it in your hands while it’s being charged. Other than that I do like it

 I love this TOZO charger because it stands out from the rest. It is definitely easier to find at night. I just gave one to a friend as a gift because she kept asking for it. It charges just about everything I placed on their this far when it comes to phones and ear buds. It charges pretty quickly and its very stylish. It goes perfectly with my room decor. It is thinner then the first TOZO charger I purchased. It is the same size as my echo spot.
","
Easy to use, very convenient, but it does take a while to charge. I didn’t find that it was very fast but I usually put my phone on it overnight
","
Great little charger, light is green when full battery or standby, blue when charging. I don’t see the little light at night. Thought it might bug me, but I don’t even notice.  It is powerful enough to charge my phone with a card carrying case, had a different charger before and it couldn’t charge through my license and a credit card. This charger chargers through both just fine, so I’m very happy with it! USB plugs into my outlet with a 2.4 amp usb socket, other wise may need a USB adapter to plug the USB into. Great price, great product. One month in.
","
I like the look of this charger but it’s SO slow. And if I don’t have my phone place just perfect I wake up with an uncharged phone for the day. 10/10 for aesthetic but 1/10 for charging power
","
Plug and play baby. I have a 5v 2.1amp adapter which this product could put out way more charging power and even with my adapter it charges pretty fast. Looks great the length of the cord is optimal. The light is hardly anything but u can see so it won’t bother at night. Unfortunately, I ordered gold color and on the box it was marked at gold but the color I got is most definitely rose gold. Fortunately, it still looks damn good, love the color.
","
Working as advertised. Very clean appearance with enough weight to let you know somethings there.
","
Easy to use.  Lays flat on counter and out of the way.  I love the rose gold color.  Yes it does take longer than a regular charger but if you're not in a hurry it's fine.  I typically charge my phone first thing in the morning while having my coffee and then go get ready for the day. By the time I'm ready, the phone is ready.  If you are in a hurry then charge by cord.  You can't go wrong with this charger and it's reasonably priced.
","
This is so handy and cute and awesome to use and travel with! My only critique is it doesn’t charge with my Defender Otter box case on but if I take off just the rubber shell it charges.

I have to spend at least 5 minutes every time I want to charge placing my phone down at different angles trying to get this to work. Even if I do get it to connect there’s a 50% chance it’ll stopped charging or not actually charge my device at all. Under no circumstances would I recommend. It is not reliable and difficult to use.
","
I love this thing overall, but it charges very slowly (probably to prevent over charging during overnight use) and because of the design I can’t use a pop socket or anything similar because they block the charger from working. This probably wouldn’t matter for the average person, but I’m on my phone pretty much all day using social media and playing games and I have small hands. My phone gets dropped pretty regularly because I can’t put any kind of holder on it. That doesn’t have anything to do with the charger itself, though. If you don’t need to have anything attached to the back of your phone it’s amazing, and it looks nice on my desk and my bedside table. The color also changes when snarfing or not so it’s easy to see if it’s positioned correctly.
","
The charger was nice but did not charge as fast or best it seems. I had issues with getting phone to charge or recognize it. Did not like
","
I bought this to charge my galaxy ear buds. It seems to work really well and charges fast. I have a silicone case on my ear buds and it charges them while the case is on. It is definitely worth the price and makes charging so much easier and convenient.  I never leave them on the charger very long as they charge fast and I don't want to worry about them getting to hot.
","
I'm really happy with my new wireless charger. While not having to get the USB-B plug into the awkwardly placed opening in the back of my TOZO T10s is totally worth the extra cost what I really appreciate about the design is the small, discreet charge light. Other wireless chargers light-up like disco balls announcing their status. Since I keep this on my nightstand that single, non-intrusive light is welcome.

Charging my IPhone
","
This definitely is a fair alternative if you want a fairly expensive look at a low price. But you can still tell its price by the weight and size. Also please read as it is USB not AC adapter. Overall, would buy again for the pricing but if you need FAST and RELIABLE and DURATION get a pricier one
","
Works exactly as described! I wasn’t prepared for the light on the charging pad to be on all the time, so hopefully that doesn’t use up too much power or burn out over time. Extremely pleased that it charges my phone perfectly, as well as husband’s phone that has a thick case around it! I love the rose gold color so much! So happy with my purchase I ended up ordering another for my husband! It’s perfect for overnight charging, because who really needs super fast charging when you’re sleeping?
","
Was originally bought for husband, Worked well for husbands iphone XR. Just for curiosity, tested it on my devices. Did not work at all for my samsung galaxy a model.  Did not work for ipad mini either. Very useful for people who forget to plug their phone in.
","
and the Matt black one is near useless the lights on the side is hard to see and tell when it's charging and everything has to be just right to charge but the rose gold and white is amazing it is easy to see the lights on top and no matter how I set the phone it works.
","
Easy to get phone charging in this pad. Set my Samsung S10 in a ruggedized case on it and the phone lights right up to indicate it's charging. It doesn't seem to charge any faster than the 4 y/o Samsung charger I'm replacing it with, but it does use the newer connector. If I need a fast charge the cable connects to my phone and it's quick charging then. The lights though. Super bright and always on. Kinda annoying.
","
This works very well.  Easy to set up and easy to use.  I am using with an iPhone 11 Pro Max and it works great.  Charges through my case.  I use this on my desk, so when I need to charge I just set my phone on the charger.  The lights change from green to blue to indicate it is charging.  The charging pad is slim and seems to be very high quality.
","
Picked up one of these extremely reasonably priced magnetic chargers for my new iPhone 12. The charger jumps up off the table and clings precisely to my phone when I get it near the phone. Pretty cool! Charging was quick. Doesn't come with a charging block, but has a USB-C to USB-A adapter. It definitely charges faster than an ordinary charging pad. This is a few millimeters larger than the official mag-safe charger, so it won't fit docks made for those, but it seems durable and looks great.
","
The charger works perfectly and it looks great. Samsung Galaxy S10+ fast charges with no problems. The issue I have is that it makes noise while charging. Weird, right? I thought so too. If you sleep with a fan or other white noise, or if you plan on using this while at a desk or otherwise while awake then it's good to go. If you plan on using it on a nightstand while you're trying to sleep in silence then you'll hear a light repeating electronic beeping feedback sound that sometimes changes cadence and frequency. The instant the phone is removed from the charger it stops, then starts back up again with the phone charging.
","
Bought the matte puck with the logo on it thinking that would solve the LED problem. It didn’t. There is an LED on the side of that one that stays on permanently. When the phone is charging, it turns from green to blue. Otherwise, it is a great product and works flawlessly. I still really like it even if I have to use something to cover the LED at night.Broke within the year.
","
I needed wireless charge for my desk and travel, I came across this TOZO charge ""Amazon Recommended"". after reading the good reviews ordered it. It just arrived today. Opened it and pleasantly surprised, its light weight, the design is beautiful and compact. The material they used is feels very good and looks sheik on my desk.I can put and pull my phone on and off the charger quicker, better than plugging in your cable charger.Nice little gadget to add to my desk.  5 stars
","
This has a sleek design & is great for charging at home, or for a quick charge when traveling. I’ve had problems with my IPhone & regular charger overheating before (even when I’m not using it), and this does a great job avoiding the fast temperature increase.
","
This is the perfect size, but charges very slowly.

 This charger is awesome for edge price. I didn’t think it would work that well or look high quality, but it turns out it’s pretty nice. Charges my phone and headphones really easily. I can place my phone in a lot of different angles on the pad and it still charges. Worth checking out.
","
I have had this product for about a year now. It is very sleek and high quality, and looks very presentable on my desk. The lights on the outside allow you to ensure that your phone is charging at a glance. I have an iPhone 11 currently and I can see the lights even around my case, although a larger phone like an iPhone 11+ may get in the way of the lights. When I had a slim wallet case on my iPhone 8 with 3 cards in it, it still had no problem charging my phone. Great product, especially for the price.
","
It’s a really beautiful wireless charger… I love how it looks. The first one I ordered did not work (charge my phone), but a replacement was very quickly sent out and this one works just fine! The only thing that I took away 1 star for is that it is slower to charge. So I would not bring it traveling with me or use it in a situation where I needed more power very quickly… However it is great for overnight charging. Would buy from again!
","
I like this charger, but the charging speed and power is not as great as I thought it would be.  It is convenient for travel, and allows me to free up my iPhone charger to charge my other Apple devices at the same time. Overall, I think this is a decent charger, but not the most powerful.
","
Great little charger for you desk or table. Very straightforward use as well. Note that this does not come with the usb outlet adapter.I am nowhere near having supersonic hearing, but there is a faint - yet noticeable - beeping when this thing is plugged in. For that reason, I make sure to unplug it when not in use. I like that it charges relatively quickly and doesn’t heat my phone much.
","
Great looking charger. I really liked it, but it started randomly either not charging or worse causing my battery to discharge when using overnight. Finally just stopped working. Only lasted 3 months as a charger, now a nice coaster.
","
We love having it in the kitchen. No more people asking to use a charger because it’s universal. That’s the coolest feature. I love How thin it is and you can easily tell whether your device is charging or not. One thing I would Add for future models is some kind of sound as a charging indicator as well.
","
I like the fact the charger is easy to put on and take off the charger. But I dislike the facts it ask for a 5v adapter to charge the pad and it 10-15 mins with an iPhone XR it will only charge 3-5 percent. Besides that the charge is incognito to my little ones.
","
Works great for charging my iPhone 11.  Very nice sleek design, attractive on my nightstand.  Phone doesn't have to be perfectly lined up to charge like some of these types of chargers, I just plop it down on there it that's it.  The indicator lights are very soft so they do not disturb at night, yet easy to see during the day.  Not the absolute fastest, but it's not agonizingly slow either.  If I need a very fast quick charge I use my regular charger.
","
Heard about this device on social media, and had to give it a try. Immediately, fell in love with the ease. I seriously can just absentmindedly place my device down and it's charging. Not even just my model of iPhone- I've had no issues charging my friend's different versions of iPhones and androids. I've had it just over a month and haven't had any charging issues thus far (a concern I usually face with affordable charging options). Absolutely recommend at least trying.
","
I was surprised but delighted that this wireless charger can charge my Samsung S22 Ultra even with its Otterbox Defender case on.  It looks very sleek too.
","
Took the plunge on a wireless charger after seeing these on a lightening deal.  I've been wanting one for my Iphone for a while now since capability came in the newer phones.  Also, I have some other items like bluetooth earbuds that have a power case that can charge on the dock.  Haven't had this charger for long, but so far it works great.  The price was fantastic. And what really amazed me the most is that not only do I have a protective case on my Iphone, but also  a Popsocket attached to the back.  I was worried that the Popsocket would prevent the phone from receiving a charge since the phone has to sit on the dock with the collapsed Popsocket in between.  It still receives the charge.
","
I am changing my review to 5 stars.  Inconsistent charge was due to not connecting the usb cable all the way in.  My bad.It is a nice looking product however does not work well.  It turns on and off.  Does not charge consistently.  Tried changing the phone position, did not fix the issue.
","
I can charge my Samsung s22 ultra in case with 3 credit cards in the holder. I bought 2 of this
","
I like this thing. I bought this to use primarily for charging my AirPods but I also use it to charge my iPhone. This does charge more slowly than a charging cable, but I think that is to be expected. If I'm using my cell phone while charging it on this (to listen to music but not actually touching the phone) it holds the charge but does not charge any further until I stop using the phone completely. Regardless, I still give it 5 stars because it works well for my needs and is really easy to use.
","
El diseño está demaciado sofisticado. No me gustó que se vea conectar con un cable de celular, se sabe que estos no deben permanecer conectados entonces pierde practicidad. Debería traer su propia conexión que regule el ingreso de energía cuando no se esté usando.
","
It’s a perfect charger for me and I don’t have any issues with using this since it doesn't have any advanced features. Simply set it up and bam that’s all.I sleep with it on my nightstand so at night it is a little bright but i flip it on its underside occasionally to cure the light annoyance. It’s more of a mirror look but doesn’t break easily unless forced to.
","
I use this on my desk in my home office.  It does not charge quickly, however it is perfect to just set and forget.  Very convenient for travel also.
","
I have a few wireless chargers and I love the convenience of just placing my phone and earbuds on top of the plate without having to fumble with a plug.  This charger is really portable and charges my phone quickly.  I have an iPhone 8 so I haven't been able to try the magnetic feature yet but it sounds like a great idea.  I am surprised how many people I know have never seen a wireless charger and am planning on getting a few of these as holiday gifts for them.
","
This wireless charger is great. It charges my kindle paperwhite and iphone flawlessly. You just lay them right on top of the charger and it charges through the case which is great and convenient. If you need a reasonable priced wireless charger then this on is great.
","
Bueno dice wireless sin cable connector y es super lento cargador oh talvez no se la manera correcta de usarlo.talvez necesito mas information..
","
This was my first wireless charger. It came with a really thoughtful USB-to USB-C adapter which was useful because I am attaching this to my desktop. I thought it would be able to work through my rubber case, but it does not. Perhaps I need to find a wireless charging compatible case.  When I put my phone on the charger, it stays attached with a magnet, so it doesn't slide off and you can be confident that it's charging. It's low-profile and looks nice and not cheapo. Would recommend!
","
I like this charger when it’s works. A lot of the time it will not charge. It may to do with dust on it. I have to wipe it off to make  it charge my phone. When it does work it’s great.
","
I use it to charge my phone at night and it works perfect, although sometimes if its not placed properly, it will not charge. Just be sure to place it in the center and should work exactly how it should.
","
This is quite the little charger! I got it to keep my new earbuds charged but it also charges my samsung phone, a different set of earbuds & discovered it charges all my devices & even my neighbors 2 cell phones! You just can't find a quality wireless charger for a better price & it looks really nice as well. I will be getting a second one for my son! I would highly recommend this product!
","
I got this hoping it was like my husbands dock charger which is quite fast, but it was not. The phone takes hours to charge
","
Works well even through my wallet case. Not my quickest charger but definitely the easiest to use. My only issue is that it slides around more than Quinn Mallory. Need a set of better grips on the bottom.
","
It's a sleek looking charging pad, and arrived in perfect condition. However, it shipped days later than it was supposed to which was quite inconvenient. Also, I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and this charger is not fast charge compatible with my phone. All in all, it's a good purchase if you have a healthy phone battery and don't mind charging it overnight while you sleep, but if your battery drains quickly and you need to charge throughout the day, it may not be the right one for you. I'll be shopping for another.
","
This is a great charger. Small light indicates charging status without lighting up the entire room. Works with a thin case on the phone. Fast charging. Large charging area so no problem finding the connection spot. Just place it on the charger. No messing with a plug. Attractive design and doesn’t take up much room. I can highly recommend it.
","
Very light and small charging station. Very portable and easy for travel. My favorite thing is it does not need an AC adapter. It can be plugged into a USB port or into any wall adapter. This product beats the rest due to that simple fact. I'm very impressed with this wireless charger. I may buy a second one just to have another one on the other side of the house. 10/10 would recommend to anyone and would personally purchase again.
","
I have been using this wireless charger every day for about 3 and a half months now and no problems to report. It works perfectly and has actually improved my sleep exponentially because I put my phone down and don't fiddle with it all night. The light changes from green to blue when your phone is successfully charging so you know it's properly placed. I also have a popsocket and I just take the top off and it charges just fine through the sticky part.The design is thin and modern so it looks nice sitting on my night stand. I suppose the only complaint I could make is that the light can be a little bright if you like a pitch black room, but it's really a great device overall!
","
I bought this one for my husband and I already had one. We love them! Every once in a while i will wake up the next day and my phone hasn’t charged when I thought I placed it on correctly but that could be my mistake as well. We love these chargers though and they just look so sleek in our bedroom.
","
Not impressed. I have to take my phone case off for it to charge, and I’m not sure why, but it stops charging in the middle of it. I would return it but no longer have the box.*update*Customer service reached out to me and offered to replace it or an Amazon gift card, so that makes me  happy.
","
I read other reviews where people said the phone will charge with the case, but mine will not.  I have to pry my phone out of the case to use this, and then it works perfectly.  I would recommend this product if you don't use a case, but my leather iPhone case is apparently too thick.
","
This product was looking good with light weight for carrying
","
Charging TOZO ear buds. I tried it once on my I Phone.This is a nice little charger to be able to stick in your purse and take with you. I thought I could charge it and take it with me to work but that didn't work for me. It charged my phone fast. Returned it case my ear buds didn't work for me and I bought them as a set.  THank you
","
This is a very good charger for the price. I dont play around with it at all. Just set the phone on and its charging. Its nice and compact so traveling with it will be easy. It also charges very fast which is nice. I have tons of AC adapters so the fact that ot doesn't come with one wasnt a problem. I would say so far thats only con I can think of.  Its a real worth while wireless charger and I have no regrets buying it.
","
This is my first wireless charger so I dont have much experience with them. What I don't like about this one is it charges slow (not a problem since I use it for charging on my nightstand through the night) and also that if you don't place it centered well it wont charge. Woke up a few morning with an uncharged phone. This can be avoided if you just pay attention to the color of the light emitted as it changes to blue when it is charging.
","
How easy it is to use. but not clear it doesn’t work with old phones
","
Overall great product, It was easy to set up (just plug it in and it’s ready) and it even works through my case. I don’t know how good the charging power is yet but i’m sure it will be good enough for 100% over night. I would like to point out there is no box or charging brick (whatever you call them) that comes with it. It would be very nice if they could include one in the package. Even raise the price a little if you have to.
","
Where to begin? Well for starters, it's super thin, the glass like finish is super, the metal feels well crafted strong and the LED lighting adds a nice ambient effect. Charging wise, I haven't a single complaint. I have mine hooked to a QC adapter and it does indeed provide fast wireless charging. Very cool and super convenient for someone who likes to forgo unhooking cords every time they charge their phone. Also works well with my Tozo T6 headphones so total thumbs up
","
This charging pad is absolutely thin. Charging power is great for any device that supports Qi charging. I was able to charge Tozo T12 wireless earbud, my galaxy S8, daughters airpods pro, galaxy s10. Absolutely easy to use, great to pack up for traveling. Supports fast charging on my phone. Awesome. Really amazed at how thin it is. Highly recommend.NOTE: phone cases will interfere  with charging. I have yet to find a wireless charger that mitigates that issue.
","
Love the sleek, simple look of this charger. I keep it on my computer desk so that I have a great way to charge up my phone while I'm working. No fishing for a cord fallen behind the desk. It is slow but works for my Pixel 5g.
","
This charger works great,  and I love the way it looks. I recently got a new IPhone and the case that I bought made charging with a plug inconvenient. This this works great. I just set my phone down and go. The convenience is wonderful. I have not used it for traveling purposed, but throw it in a bag, plug it in wherever you go and it would be just as convenient. No more fumbling with plugs and making sure it connects properly.  I highly recommend!
","
I haven't tested the max charging speed, but seems to charge wireless devices placed on it (haphazardly) fairly quickly. It looks very shiny, too, which is a nice bonus. I'm not a huge fan of the lights being on constantly, as opposed to only briefly when devices are placed for charging, but it just means this isn't a night time bedroom wireless charger. I already have another one for that, so no big loss, but it still seems wasteful. Overall a good purchase when on sale.
","
I really like the build quality of this charger. It has a nice weight to it and because it is made our of aluminum it is sturdy. It also looks very sleek and stylish. They should update their ad however. My charger doesn't light up on the top. There is a small LED on the side that lights up to let you know which state the charger is in. It also seems to charge pretty quickly which is nice. Overall, it's a good charger and should last me a long time. I would buy this product again without hesitation.
","
This charger is an upgrade from the previous model. When I put my iPhone on the charger it is fully charged within minutes. This is combined with the Tozo power block that I also use. I would highly recommend this product. It uses USB C, but comes with an adapter.Pros: Small, magnet is strong, and it works well.Cons: It's Small (if you didn't want that) and that's it.
","
Your device won’t charge if it’s not on the charger just right.  It’s hard to see the light on the charger to tell if it’s blue or green.  By the way the light is blue if your device is charging.
","
Looks great on my nightstand. So easy to charge my phone. I’m pregnant and about to have a baby and don’t want to have to search for a plug. It works great and charges my phone fast.

I got this for an iPhone 11pro with a Catalyst case on it. With the case, which is thin plastic on the back, the magnet barely sticks at all. I can still get the phone positioned to charge on it with some fiddling, but then it charges very slowly. It may work for an overnight charge, but because of the necessary fiddling to even get it to charge, I'm going to be returning it.
","
The charger is really thin which makes it very useful for me. I have it under my monitor and there's enough clearance for my iPhone XR with an Otter case to fit on it with room left to spare.  It came with its own charging cable USB-C and seems to charge the XR pretty quickly compared to other charges I have.
","
Easy to use. Very sleek and nice looking. Charged my phone in minutes - I was amazed at that. The directions that come with it are printed with about a 1 pitch font. I don’t think I could have even read it with a magnifying glass so that was a challenge because I knew nothing about these devices. So I had to wing it. Then my daughter suggested I go to the website so I’m hoping that will give me more information.
","
Looks nice and works fine, slower than wired charger but does the job. Make sure the device is charging before you walk away or you may come back after hours to learn that it never kicked off
","
The charging power is dependent on the USB source. Not something I use for travel, I just put it on my desk. It is easy and convenient to use.
","
This product works very well! It's easy, classy, and a space saver. Charging power is good, a bit slower for my Note 21 but still charges goid enough. My Note 8 charges faster with it. I love it.  EasY sleek, & would definitely recommend it.
","
I use this to charge my iPhone XR, it doesn't seem to be a lightening charge but I generally charge overnight so not really an issue. The charger is super thin and has pads on the bottom so it does't slide around. There are always-on lights on top of the charger - green when it's plugged in (not charging) and blue when phone is on the pad and charging, it does turn back to green when the phone is fully charged. I thought the light might be too bright but it's a soft glow. For the price, I don't think you're going to find a nicer looking charger. So far so good!
","
Looks great on my desk and works just as good
","
It is very convenient to just be able to set my phone or earbuds on this unit. it shows when it's charging and when it's charged. I'm sure there are alternate units available, but this is a good looking unit that sits on my night stand and is unobtrusive. It was a wise purchase.

 This charger works great! This is my second wireless charger. I purchased the W1 like 6 months ago and this one is a bit smaller and slimmer, which I like, but I think I like how the W1 led lights are on the top of the pad! It charges my S10e and iPhone 12 minis quickly with the phone cases on with no problems whatsoever!🤩
","
Quick set up. Easy to use and makes working with my older phone with a wireless adapter much more dependable. It arrived quickly and was packaged wellOf special note there is a clear circular film placed on the surface for protection. Mine didn’t come off with the removal sticker as it should have. I had to remove it with a tweezer.  If we hadn’t ordered two, I wouldn’t have known there was more than the sticker to remove. Not a big deal but important to know it needs to be removed before use
","
I have the other tozo wireless charger as well and I figured it’d be nice to have another around the house. The first one is pretty thin on its own already, but this one is even thinner and it works perfectly like the other one. Charges my earphones pretty quickly and my iPhone trickle charges overnight very well. It’s excellent for the money and I highly recommend either this one or the other one. The charger is great and I’m sure it would pair very well with 10 watt charging on android phones. I highly recommend.
","
I have purchased from Tozo in the past, and particularly like the NC9 earbuds, so I purchased this when I received an offer from Tozo.  The unit looks very nice, it's slimmer than the other wireless change I own, and it's very light.  It works well with both our iPhones (11 and 12 Pro Max), even with a case on the phone.  I like the charger a lot.I received a promotional offer to purchase this unit, but my review is strictly my own opinion.
","
Great charger.  Very thin.  Very sleek looking.  Doesn't take up much space on my desk.It works with both my Galaxy S10 and my wife's iPhone and has charged them through the case (though i have a thin case).Only caviat is that you need to make sure you've placed it down in the right spot or sometimes it won't charge.  Other than that, I'm very happy with this guy and it's such a relief to be able to just put my phone down and have it charge rather than fiddle with the USB-C or Lightning cables.
","
I love the design, nice and wide, white with a gold accent.  Wow. My iPhone 12 pro max fit and perfectly.  The nice thing about this charger, it lights up green when not in use and it turns blue when it’s charging. It works better in typical Chargers of its kind, the iPhone 12 loves it, it charges every time you put that unlike others.  I highly recommend this charger because it’s reliable, made out of quality components, and it has a beautiful design.

Lo recibí hoy , hasta ahora todo bien cómodo y si , solo hay que colocar encima de la plataforma , tengo galaxi8s y los audifonos de airpods , como de usar , se me dañó el puerto de carga del celular y con esto es mi solucion el cable USB es simple único defecto

I was told at a Verizon store that because my phone would not charge with my charger that I would have to buy a new phone. they were absolutely wrong (just wanted to sell me a new phone). Nothing was wrong with my phone except it got a glitch in the software. Bought wireless charger from Amazon, charged phone and it corrected the glitch in software. So instead of spending $1,000.00 for new phone I spent $12.00 to fix my phone. Hope this will help unsuspecting people who have or have had same circumstances.
","
It's small and sleek looking but it will show the blue charging light, even when it's not charging. Waking up to a dead phone sucks.Worse, sometimes the light will flash teal/blue and is it charging? Who knows! It's a complete dice roll.Putting a bright blue LED on your product makes it clear that you are marketing to teenagers. Adults value their sleep and Blue LED reflects off the wall several feet away and can be seen through closed eyes. Boo-hiss!
","
Very aesthetically pleasing and definitely lightweight and portable, but i find that the charging is inefficient. It does work, but i find that in order to properly charge my phone overnight i need to turn it on airplane mode before going to bed. (i have iphone se 2nd gen if it makes a difference). i think however that this may just be a problem with wireless charging overall and is not the product’s fault.
","
The product arrived on time in excellent condition. The instructions are clear and concise and I was able to set it up and start charging within a few scant minutes. My phone reacted immediately without the need for any additional programming or downloading of apps. I was concerned over whether it would work with the case on my phone, but thank goodness, it worked without a hitch. I fully reccomend this product and another little piece of assurance is that it has a 1 year extended warranty.
","
You see when i had first got this charger i thought it would be the one i used the most. No no it was not the charging speed of it very slow and i was using a usb c to usb c wire for the wireless charger. The charger isn't all bad it has a nice feeling and very slim i use it for my airpods while my phone is on another charger.to wrap this all up if you want it for your phone i would not recommend for things like headphone i would recommend

I think I may be late to the wireless charging game but better late than never. This device is amazing! A friend at work let me try it before buying it. I have a hard case and pop socket on my phone and the charge still works. I was truly surprised. Later the same day one of our office tech guys let me try his wireless charger (different brand) and it did not work. I knew I was buying Tozo.No more fumbling to plug in my phone at night before bed. Gone are the days where I thought my cord was fully plugged in but it was just shy of connecting. I haven’t “loved” a product as much as this in a long time. It borders on being magical!
","
Had to remove magnet case before charging but works great.
","
I was surprised by how thin this wireless charger is. I have a few of the older non-fast charging models from other manufacturers and while they aren't that thick...they aren't this thin! The USB-C cable that comes with it fits perfectly. I've had other cables where the cable causes the charger to not sit flush on the ground. So far, every time I've put my phone on the charger, it has connected instantly, without any issue, and always Fast Charging. I'm using the the same adapter that comes with a Samsung 9+.I received this as a promotional gift for purchasing the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds. The case has wireless charging and it was nice of them to include this with their other product. The case also works perfectly with this product as expected.
","
This charger does charge. It isn't a fast charger but that's okay because it doesn't heat up or heat up the phone. I was a bit disappointed by the color though as I was expecting gold but the charger is actually white with a thin gold rim and bottom side.
","
I asked for light blue. I got a black one that lights up green when on, and when I place my phone on it it turns Dark Blue. My last one of these broke super fast so I'm hoping it doesn't happen again.
","
Works well and looks nice overall. Only concern is that I ordered “champagne” color expecting it to be light gold like in the photo. When received, the box says color is “khaki” and that’s more accurate. It’s a matte tan color. Not bad looking but not what I expected. It works well for what I need it for but I would’ve ordered a different color had I known.
","
I have an otterbox popsocket case on my iPhone 11 Pro Max and the wireless charging worked without a hitch. Easy to set up, you will just need a wall charger since it doesn't come with one unless you plug it into a USB port. I was changing out an old charger so this wasn't an issue for me. The rubber pads on the bottom keep the charger in place so I don't have to worry about it sliding off of my desk. Love this charger!
","
It was well disingenuous and easy to use. You have to put your phone on certain angle to charge, but it does not bothering me. I see some comments about the led light is too bright, I consider myself as a sensitive sleeper, however I don’t think it’s too bright. Yes you can see the blue light when it’s charging, but it’s not too bright to distract the sleep. My charger has some problem, I contact the customer service, they replied me right away and promised me a new one for replacement, great customer service!!
","
Looks very nice, the aesthetics (LED lights, then design, and the glass top) is what makes this charger sell. I wish the light would turn red (and blink) if there is FOD in the charger, blinking green doesn’t intuitively indicate there is a problem (green = good, red = bad)Of course wireless charging is inefficient, and so it doesn’t really charge very quickly, but at least it looks really good doing it
","
This charger has saved my life because my phone will not charge with a wall charger anymore. I have had it for several months now. I put my phone on the charger at night time with the case on. The light changes from green to blue while it’s charging. When it’s done charging the light turns green. The light is tiny so it isn’t distracting or anything when I’m trying to go to sleep.
","
Charger works well with the ear buds and I also can charge my phone
","
I purchased this charger for my iPhone 12 because of the price to try it out. This charger says exclusively for iPhone 12 but I also have a note 20 ultra and wireless headphones and it fast wireless charges those also.  The magnet that allows it to stick to the iPhone blows my mind every time and it's strong! I already have c type compatible blocks so the extra adapter was a bonus great for car rides or even portable power banks! Thanks Tozo you did it again!
","
Great customer service.  At first I couldn’t get the product to work. I tried every thing that I could think of. When I emailed the company, Alisa was very responsive and work through the problem. It turned out my phone just need to be rebooted to except the charging. I love the thin design and it’s ease-of-use. Getting the phone to connect up is easy with simple placement on the circular design. I’ll be buying another for another room in the house.
","
Super sleek and compact. Aesthetically it’s a beautiful wireless charger. When it’s powered on the light on the face of the charger is green, when charging a device the light turns blue so you know it is charging. You can’t fit more than one device at a time as they have to be centered to charge. If that’s not an issue for you this is a really nice small charger that doesn’t take up much space!
","
As the title says...this was given to me on Christmas for my iPhone 12 Pro. Image my surprise that it would not charge the phone with a case on it but will charge the phone without a case (although it is finicky...it is like it has to be aligned perfectly for this.I am disappointed in this.*UPDATE* The company has responded and has compensated me for the defective item. I give them 5 stars for their communication and willingness to respond and fix the problem.
","
The wireless charger arrive on time and it looks as sleek as in the pictures.  Unfortunately, there was an issue with the charging capability in that it would charge, and then pause for a while, and then charge, and in the end would not charge a device (tried both Samsung and iPhone).  However, customer service has been really helpful and very responsive and they have agreed to send a new one that I am looking forward to receiving and will update this review when it arrives.
","
I had an Anker wireless charger that quit working after about a year of use, so decided to try the TOZO wireless charger....and very glad I did.  I have their wireless earbuds that have been a wonderful surprise and investment, so decided to try the TOZO charger  In addition to being very thin, the wireless charger looks much nicer and “substantial” sitting on the counter. The rubber strips on bottom keep it from sliding around and the LED lights show if the item is charging (you do not have to check the phone display to see if the phone is charging). The charger has performed flawlessly and I will certainly add the TOZO branding to my preferred list.
","
This came as an additional item to my order so it was excellent value for money. Seems to work well, but haven't fully used it yet.

 I love how small and portable this charger is. It will be convenient to take with me when traveling. I think it is also nice that it comes with an adapter- I can foresee this coming in handy if someone's iPhone dies and there is somebody else with an android that has some power to spare. As always, Tozo's customer service is outstanding as well. Would certainly reccomend.
","
While this charger isn't anything special as far as capabilities, it is an extremely thin wireless charger that is aesthetically pleasing. A lot of wireless chargers are blocky and black which isn't very nice looking. Not including an AC charger, while annoying, is common for these chargers at this point so not a big deal because most people have them laying around.
","
My phone is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. I used to plug my phone into a wired fast charger at my desk. I'm using the same fast-charging wall adapter with this Tozo wireless charger. As soon as I put my phone on the charger, I get a notification that the charger is not compatible with fast charging and that my phone will be charging at the standard speed. So they falsely advertise ""Fast Charging"" which is why I'm only giving 2 stars. I guess you get what you pay for. IF, however, you just need a sleek charger and don't care about fast charging, for $10 this is a decent charger. The USB-C cable supplied in the box is only about a foot long, so be prepared to use your own cable. I like the lights on the charger. Overall....meh. Its just another charger.
","
With my Iphone 11, you have to put the phone on the charger for it to start charging.  There's been plenty of times when I woke up the next morning to find my phone didn't charge at all the night before because I didn't get it on there just right.  It's an ok. product.  Just make sure it's charging before you leave it or you'll be very disappointed later. I wouldn't buy it again.
","
I have not used it yet, just plugged it in.  It said it did not come with a USB adapter for the wall, but that was ok since I have other adapters in my house.  I am waiting on my earbuds to see if it works with them.  Seems easy enough and intuitive enough if you have other smart devices in your home.  It also does look really nice, I have two toddlers so I hope it holds up well with them.
","
It works good it looks good but it just is so slippy slidy y’all should make it so it can stick to it somehow, if you traveling in a airport you can’t just use this with a portable because then u would have to hold your phone to it all day. It looks good for like a night stand set your phone down before u sleep don’t got find a cord or nothing.
","
Your products are a good quality, I bought 3 times todo hearpods tozo t10 are very good sound but unfortunately doesn’t hold well in hears if you design a good one with good holders, to exercise I am able to pay more , because the sound quality is as good as bose tree sports, is what I am using right know but are very expensive.Regards.
","
Elegant, Sleek, Modern, Functions Perfectly.I’ve been looking for a wireless charger to fit my minimalist aesthetic, this purchase was perfect!Not too bulky and the charging cord is long enough to reach the wall socket behind my bed.It even charges WITH my otterbox case on, which has a pop socket in the back. This wireless charger has superior performance to any other I have tried and the pricing was beyond reasonable.10/10 would recommend to friends, family, and associates.
","
I got this wireless charger to use to charge my TOZO earbuds.  The earbuds come in a charging case that i can put on this wireless charger. The charger is small and sleek and cool looking.  It works great. I just put the case on the charger and i am always charged and ready to go! I am sure it works great for phones too but my phone is too old to charge wirelessly......But boy i wish i could!  Love this charger!
","
This charger can fast charge my Samsung Galaxy S10+, just as fast as the Samsung Fast Wireless Chargers, and almost as fast as the fast wall chargers. It also charges my earbud case as well (I have a cheapo $30 pair of buds that the case is wireless charging compatible). It can be a little fiddly to get the phone centered just right so it will fast charge, versus a normal (non-fast) charge, but no more so than the Samsung chargers. Such is the nature of wireless charging, I guess.
","
Great for charging my earbud case! I haven’t gotten it to work through my pop socket otter box though which is a bummer but I really wanted it for my earbud case anyway so I’m not disappointed. I love the sleek design and it’s simple and easy to use!
","
Trying to buy American made products, didn't realize until I received made in China
","
Es súper cómodo fácil de usar y portar
","
I have purchased several of these charging disks. They look wonderful, seem well made and work as advertised. Able to charge through any phone cover I have.  Indicator light is helpful to let you know it’s charging. Nice to have in common areas of the house as guests always ask if I have a charger. A wired charger is faster but still charge at a acceptable rate.
","
This charger does a better job than others I’ve had. It’s definitely easier to get it charging - you don’t have to be very specific about how you lay it down; it seems to find a way to start charging. But my table isn’t completely level, and I have trouble with my iPhone sliding off to one side and losing the charging connection. It’s not really the fault of the unit, but the glass back of my phone on the glass of the charger makes it too slippery to be totally reliable. Otherwise it’s a good charger.
","
I was pleasantly surprised to find that this wireless charger charges a pixel 3xl rapidly. I did not expect such a cheap charger to do this when google's own pixel charger is so expensive. This is an added bonus to me as I bought this just to charge my tozo nc9 plus. Very happy with the results.
","
I bought this charger to use on my white nightstand.  The white/silver color I selected blends nicely with the nightstand.  The charger has a nice build quality, glass and metal, and looks really nice.  I also like the status light which indicates if it is charging or not, and when the phone sits on the charger, the light is hidden a little so it isn't too bright when you are sleeping next to it.  The rubber feet help keep it in place.
","
They work great and the unit is better, than most other similar chargers from a contact stand point. I have a pop socket on my phone and it’s able to go thru that. It has two big cons... the cord is way too short. You better hope the socket is directly behind whatever table you’re using.  Also it only has a usb cord, so you’ll need and outlet attachment to be able to plug it in. It also has an abnormal connector to the charging plate. So your iPhone charger will not attach to it. Nor will the trapezoid shaped connector work.
","
it’s cute however even without a case on it, it rarely charges my phone. out of the 20 times I put my phone down onto the charger, it will start charging maybe one of those times
","
I have two of these.  One by my bed and one at my desk.  I can charge my Tozo T6 or T9 ear buds, my airpods, or my iPhone.  It takes up little room and is so easy to use.  The light turns from green to blue so I know it is charging the device I have laid on top of it.  It is also very portable for traveling.  I want to buy one for every room in the house. Thanks TOZO.
","
I've just gotten this so my review can't speak to the longevity of the product, I will come update the review of it stops working.So far so good! Simple installation, just plug it in. Has a slight rubber-like coating on the top to protect the phone from scratching and keep it in place during charging. Also little rubber feret to keep the chargers itself from moving around. Placed my phone on it and it instantly began charging, what more could you want! Top notch.
","
They should be sold by the six pack
","
Works great
","
I purchased this for my TOZO EAR BUDS and my IPhone but it seems to be very temperamental and I keep having to leave my phone on it for a lot longer than it states on the box for this time it will take to charge a device. I love the TOZO brand as I have bought items before but this particular one has some issues.
","
Title says it all.I purchased the Apple wireless charger as well and it is a pain to center the charger on your iPhone with a otter box defender. This charger does not require any centering, just place your phone on the charger and it works.  It is not a rapid charger so don’t expect to charge your phone in one hour.
","
After transitioning to an online environment, this is absolutely perfect and a dorm essential for any college student. I have so many things I need to charge often, and I am frequently overloading my outlets. The wireless charger by TOZO It’s perfect for my phone and my headphones. I often find myself not plugging in my phone when it gets too low, and this charger is perfect to set my phone on when I’m doing my homework, keeping myself accountable to keep it on there and let it charge while focusing on my readings. I definitely recommend this product!
","
Works very well with my Google Pixel 3.Note: Sometimes when I put the phone in the plate to charge, it doesn't go into charging mode so I lift the phone off the plate for about three seconds then I put it down in the plate again and then it displays ""Charging wirelessly"" I don't know if it's my phone, the charging plate or both.
","
I’m not super happy that it has to be plugged into the wall in order to charge since its not conveniently portable, but so far it’s working well. It doesn’t take much space at all and it seems to charge my iPhone quickly. You’ll have to position your phone onto the charger but it’s really easy-it picks up the connection from most angles.
","
Great little charging pad. The unit is definitely made in China, but seems to be very solidly constructed. Also, not sure if it is QI certified. Opened it up, plugged it in and it just worked. The charging power seems to be about the same as if it were plugged in via USB-C! I have an LG Velvet 5G phone and just used the AC adapter charging block that came with my phone. Make sure you have the phone placed on the pad in the correct position to work.
","
I liked the sleek and elegant design, but the product sucks at charging my Samsung galaxy S22 ultra.  🙃 makes a good coaster.  Can I get my money back?
","
I needed another reliable wireless charger and thought this one looked great for the price. It works fine and I like the construction but it does not fast charge my Samsung s21 ultra. I've tried three different wall warts all rated for fast charging and I get a message on everyone on my phone saying that this charger is not compatible. It's charging normally, and seems pretty quick even for that, but it's not fast charging. Caveat emptor.
","
It has the looks and it works well even through phone cases. It works good with my wife's iphone but with my Samsung my phone says fast charging not available so only charging at normal speed.
","
My sister accidentally dropped my phone in the sink so now my phone won't charge with a regular wire, but this works perfectly well. I use double-sided tape to tape one of my phone cases to it. When I need to charge my phone, I just pop the phone in the case. I can charge my phone while using it with no problem.
","
The wireless charger didn’t work for me it wouldn’t charge my phone at all it would show it was charging for a second and then automatically disconnect.
","
I purchased this product to charge my TOZO earbuds since the earbuds use the new style USB connector and the charging cord that came with the earbuds was not very long making it necessary to locate the charging case very close to an outlet .  It is also less likely that you will accidentally damage the connector on the earbud changing case.  It quickly charges my earbuds and is much more convenient than using the cord.
","
Only charges when placed screen facing up. Would prefer to be able to charge screen down as well. Otherwise, seems to be working VERY well so far. Pleased with purchase.
","
Best I've ever used! Seriously. Don't let the price fool you and make you think it's another cheap flimsy product out of China. This is by far the fastest and most durable wireless charger ive owned or used. (make sure you use a 5V-2A wall plugin) As far as the construction of the charger, its frame is aviation grade aluminum with the tempered/hardened glass on top.Simply put its F*****G awesome! 💯💯
","
Worked fine even with case on since purchase till October. Had to take case off for it to charge. Now it won’t even charge with case off. Tried different outlet and cord, same result. It blinks light blue and doesn’t charge anymore.
","
I bought 2 of these pads several years ago.  Still work flawlessly.
","
The charger does t overheat my phone and I can charge it with my case on with no worries!
","
Este producto me encanta luce precioso muy liviano y carga muy bien pero para mi funda del teléfono es muy gruesa y no la quiero cambiar porque es muy buena, me ha ayudado mucho
","
The unit is nice and thin... feels cheap. Also the charging power is very slow. If I plug my phone in 45 minutes to an hour to full charge from 5% but if I put it on the charger its 4 hours... butbit does work and if your not in a hurry this is the charger for you.
","
I’ve had this for several months now and it works great. I love that it has a green light when it’s not charging and a blue light when it is. It also will not overcharge. I usually put my phone to charge at night, and it’s always back to the green light when it’s at 100%. I’m a new iPhone 12 owner and even though I don’t believe it’s magnetic or Qi, it started to charge it. I didn’t leave it on it. But it’s nice to know it can.
","
I previously purchased a cheaper wireless charger made of plastic and it didn't last long.  This charger is a little more expensive but the quality makes it totally worth it.  The green to blue light shift when you put your phone on it is very quick and responsive giving a very satisfying user experience.  If I had to give one criticism it would be that I wish they had used a different color than blue for charging just because in a dark room it does put a bit of ambient blue light in the room.  Red would have been a better choice as blue light does have an effect on the circadian rhythm.  That one criticism is not enough to even knock a star off, though.
","
I have an iPhone 11 Pro, and never had a wireless charger before, so this is my first experience with one.I’ve had this charger for 2 weeks now, and so far works great. My phone stays relatively cool when charging some time.I got the black one and it turns blue when it’s charging the phone. Visual cues is a Cool feature in my opinion.The only thing I would change is, I wish it charged a bit faster.
","
I got this about 2 months ago and it was working fine until about last week. It isnt charging my phone to 100%. I noticed that I have to reposition it even if I havent moved my phone at all to get it fully charged.
","
Very sleek device but would have been better as a power bank. Truthfully, what’s the big difference if you plug your charger into the phone or rest it on the wireless pad? Both give the same result. However, if I could charge this disc and keep it in my handbag or laptop case and then pop it out anywhere and rest my device on it, now that’s handy!
","
The device is 2"" in diameter, and has a physical cable attached to the charging pad which ends in a USB connector.  Package comes with a USB C to A USB a converter.  Device works on Android and Apple devices.  Does NOT Quick charge android devices (Tested with Samsung S9 & LG V30).  Tested it with a Iphone SE 2nd edition and works great.Output Power: 5W, 10W, 15WOutput Voltage: 5V-9VOutput Current: 1-1.6A
","
Does what it says. Charges slower than direct plug, but that was expected. A little finicky to get to charge, particularly since I put it on my nightstand, so not always looking exactly where I put it. Would be nice if it guided itself to charge. This is a good product.
","
I like very much that this inductive charger explicitly indicates that it stops charging when my phone is at 100%.  There are lights around the edge of the charger that are blue when it is charging and green when it's not (and off when no device is on top of it).  With other chargers, I was never quite sure that they were not overcharging the battery.
","
I bought this for work, either in my office or from the road. It is perfect, it's light weight, looks great and charges my phones while I am working. When traveling I can't count the charging cords I have accidently left behind  because they have fallen behind or under a piece of furniture. This sits on a table or night stand, always in sight.
","
Although touted as ""fast charging"", it really charges about the same speed as regular cable charging. That said, it is very convenient and saves wear and tear on USB cables.
","
This is slim and elegant. I haven't had it long enough to know how fast it charges, but so far, so good.Update after several days of use: I am quite pleased with the speed with which this charges my iPhone 12. In my case, my iPhone 12 placed on this wireless charger went from 56% to 98% in less than 1:45 (one hour and forty-five minutes). I don't know if others consider that fast, but it's plenty fast enough for me.I am pleased.
","
Doesn't have quite the charging speed advertised but it works well. I bought this because my charging connection on my phone is broken so now I can charge my phone again. My only concern is that my phone is getting hot while charging which is super dangerous. If you're looking for something to charge and look nice then definitely it fits the build. I just don't recommend using it over night. Keep an eye on it
","
I bought this because I would be traveling and didn't want to deal with the hassle of finding an outlet for my multiple devices. Great purchase! It charges my T06 earbud case within 20 or so minutes, so I never have less than four bars on the case despite using my earbuds for hours at a time. I have an older model iPhone that does not have capabilities to charge on this but will be upgrading soon, so I'm looking forward to being able to use this charger for that as well.
","
Ordered this yesterday and it arrived today. I wasn't sure if it would work out not for my wife's phone but I figured for $20 I'd give it a try. As you can see, this charger is the same thickness as her popsocket.  I plugged it into the factory charger for her phone and despite the popsocket her phone started charging.  Only time will tell if it lasts, but for now it seems like a good value for the money I spent.
","
Works as advertised
","
I love this. I took me a little bit of trial and error to get my phone positioned just right so that it would connect and charge. It takes a second or two before it chirps to let you know it connected (and flashes blue too). Works even with a pop socket on the back of my phone. Charges my phone great. I have a Samsung note 21+.
","
Update: I want to re-review this product. Initially, I had this product and after about a few weeks of use, the charging unit lost its charging power. I did all the troubleshooting and made sure it wasn't the cable or adapter. Then I was in contact with the seller and they were concerned that I got a defective unit. They rushed me a new one with no questions asked and it's been a few weeks now of using its new charger. It works great. The customer service was excellent. Highly recommend.
","
It was extremely easy to setup the item. The glass top looks gorgeous. It comes with a USB-C cable. It is super easy to get finger print on top of the charging unit.The led charging indicator is very helpful. If the device doesn't take wireless chatge it blinks green and successful charging is indicated by blue. The size of the unit was just right for me. I tried the new airpod pro, iphone 12 and tozo t10 all of them charge fine.
","
Ordered this charger for my girlfriend's new phone. Ultra sleek with a reflective black top and glowing green light. When in use, the built-in light changes to blue (so you know it's charging). It came with a USB wire to plug into your computer or existing wall plug. My girlfriend uses this one at her office desk and we bought another for her nightstand. No issues thus far (it's been a month). Also, keep in mind that it comes with a 1-yr warranty, free of charge. Be sure to activate it within 14 days of purchase.1 Year Update: Had an issue with charger not charging my phone. Contacted customer service, who quickly sent out a replacement, even though it was out of warranty. Great customer service.
","
I ordered this product and it worked great! No more having to plug my phone in anymore. Real sleek design and charges my phone just as fast as plugging it in or even faster. Easy to use and carry on the go. Customer service with this company is really nice and friendly too. I have the tozo t6 headphones to which work great with the charger! Thanks Tozo!
","
i gave this as a gift to my dad and he loved it, it's a great stocking stuffer!
","
It’s no surprise I’m a huge fan of tozo items. They are always consistently well-made and durable. I’ve been using this wireless charger for a year and just bought another one for my daughter. It’s great. ONE thing to note here is that it does not come with the wall charger part. It's USB only but you'll need to plug the USB into something in order to charge it. But most of us already have plenty of those little iPhone cubes laying around the house. :)
","
I'm impressed, this charger will charge my phone through the Otter Box case. It is small and light weight and would be easy to pack up and take on a trip. One feature that I do not care for however ism the light display. It flashes while charging and stays lit when it is not in use. I found this to be distracting at night. In order to remedy that situation I simply turn it upside down when it is not being used.
","
Nicely made.  It feels good and works well as long as you have a wall adapter that can supply enough power.  However, I think that the designer should have placed the LED lights 90 degrees around the circle from where they are now.  If they're intended to be located on either side of the phone when charging, they can only do that if you place your phone along the direction of the power cable connector.  Unfortunately the micro USB cable end tends to stick up from the surface of the charging pad slightly.  So the phone really can't sit completely flat that way.  It's not a big deal.  I just think it would have been a better design decision.  Overall nice unit.
","
Great product.  Easy to use.  I keep one at both houses.  one of our phones has a defective charging port and this saves the day.
","
Great charging with a stylish low profile. The always on indicator lights, green for powered, blue for charging, is a bit bright when in a sleep environment. I turned it 90° so my phone covers the lights when I'm trying to sleep so it's not an issue. The aesthetic would look sharp on a desktop or end table. Would buy again.
","
Easy to use
","
Ok, so I’ve owned a couple other name brand wireless chargers and the TOZO W1 charger is the FIRST one to work seamlessly with my devices!! It charges my phone through the case, and my TOZO NC2 Hybrid earbuds case with ease. There’s no finagling to get my phone in *just* the right position (crossing fingers & hoping the planets are aligned) to get it to charge. It works reliably!
","
This wireless charger is the absolute best accessory that I have purchased for my new cell phone thus far. The coolest part about it, is that it also works for my iPhone 8 Plus! However, my boyfriend has taken use of it as though it is his. We both have found this to be such a great gadget! It is very convenient to just place your phone on it without having to plug it in. The warranty that comes with it is an added bonus in my opinion. I love to spend my dollars with a company that prides themselves on selling a great product. The customer service was great with TOZO. I give them 5 stars and recommend this seller & product.

Amazing wireless charger for all the devices we have with wireless charging capabilities. Charges our phones and headphones pretty quickly. We keep it in the kitchen where it’s easily accessible and I don’t mind having it right on our counter because it’s so pretty. You can easily pack it in a bag to travel with. I also bought the TOZO wireless earbuds and am loving them so far. This is a great brand!
","
The charger came in two days via USPS.  Package was in great shape.  It came with a USB - C / USB cable. I connected it to a USB plug adapter and it works great!  I was worried that it wouldn't charge through my case, but it charges fast and without any problems.  I have a two layer heavy duty case.  No problems!The charger itself is very flat.  I got the Space Gray Color and it looks amazing!  I wish I would have ordered this months ago!
","
It was good while it lasted. The placement was very temperamental. Often after placing my phone on it before bed, the charging light would go on indicating that i placed it correctly and in charging mode, however, I would wake up to a phone with a dead battery. won't buy this model again.
","
This charger was exactly what I needed for my desk at work. Slim, low-profile, and easy to carry along with me if need be. It's charging power is just as good as the high-end wireless chargers. Simply put, its a great product.

Nice slim charger. Light weight. Works well through case, but had to take my magnetic finger ring off the phone for it to work. Just plug in and place phone on top. Super easy to use. Sleek design.

This thing is so cool, it light up for me as green when I was not using it and then light up as blue when I was using it. I don't know what the charging power of it is because I am only using this for the tozo earbuds so ya good for now is all I can say about it.
","
I was hesitant to buy this charger at first because you never really know when you're buying online. But this charger is PERFECT and is way more than I hoped it would be. It's very sleek and light weight. You do need a wall black to plug the USB into but its nice that it can also be plugged into a laptop. The LED indicator lights are green when it's plugged in and blue when its charging your phone. It then turns back to green when its done charging and at no point are these lights bright enough to wake you up when you're sleeping (and I say that as someone who must have the room pitch black). It also came with a free 1-year warranty. Highly recommend
","
Works great with Tozo wireless earphone, but when I try to charge my phone... my phone keeps showing that there is bug... so not sure if there is any security issue for charging phone
","
Drop your cell and forget it.  Takes it a while to get a good full charge.  Like 4 hrs but it beats the need to plug in
","
It works well i really like this product i just wish it came with a wall connection choice too. I have to connect it to my laptop thats charging from a wall connector so it can work.
","
It's small, charges relatively slow (perfect for overnight charging and preserves battery life better), and is dead simple to use. Just plug it into a well-powered USB port, or a charger brick, set your phone on top, and voila! You're phone's charging!Also dropped it a couple times and I haven't been able to detect any damage from it.A complete steal if you ask me - just make sure your phone is compatible with the Qi Wireless Charging thing and you're golden.
","
--Please read the whole post--It worked great for about 5 months and then it stopped working.  Only used this to charge an iPhone with no changes to the case etc.  It now only blinks and doesn't charge regardless of position.--Update--I restarted my iPhone and it started working.  It was not an issue with the charger to my knowledge.
","
It is so pretty! I love it! However, it does take a while to charge being plugged into a usb outlet. Its not as fast as the wired charge but if you're not using your phone for about 3-4 hours, its great!
","
It’s nice and thin; easy to carry in bags.  The only thing I have is my phone sometimes won’t fully charged. You have to place it correctly otherwise it won’t charge.
","
I've owned two cheaper charging stands and mats in the past, and I've basically had to stop using them shortly after getting them. They charged things okay, but the build quality was as piss-poor as an old Tiger handheld game from a 90's-era Rite-Aid with touchy ports, and they both shared the aggravating quality of making a constant high-pitched noise when they weren't charging anything. (Probably wouldn't notice it if it was in a constantly busy area like the kitchen or living room, but they're like a dripping faucet on a quiet bedroom nightstand.)Anyway, this one got everything right. The build quality is solid, and it matches my Space Grey Apple-dominant workspace. I'm probably gonna get another come Black Friday for the nightstand.

 Real simple and easy to use IMag style charger for all compatible IMag safe devices but may also work on Androids. Great for travel as well since it’s very compact and fast charging depending on your block.
","
It takes awhile to charge my phone fully. Also, I have to move my phone around for a min before it connects… there is a specific sweet spot that I have to hit for it to connect.
","
I got this charger because the charging port on my Galaxy s8 wore out after a few years and the charger kept falling out. I was ready to get a new phone, but decided to try a wireless charger before I do that. It worked like a charm! The charging is very fast, about 2-2.5 hours from empty battery to full. The best part is, I no longer need to worry about the charger staying inside the port.
","
It’s super cute and I appreciate how it stops charging once my phone is fully charged. I understand they didn’t include three charging blocks for the different phone models. I liked the feature on previous models where it displayed how charged your item is but overall it works well so far.
","
I have one that I have been using for a few months and thought it would be a great product for my mother, who owns an iphone.  Found that this is not compatible with iphone devices (well, at least my mother's) . This could be my error, but I thought I found it in the description that it was compatible, but it is not. Works great with Samsung though ;)
","
Worked, but it's just too onerous to fidget the phone to find the exact spot where it actually charges the phone. Ended up using my old one and will likely throw this one out.
","
Tried for the first time today and worked great charging my iPhone and AirPods. Looks good on desk.
","
Always wanted one of these and now I got the option for it cuz I never had an iphone. Only used it once but I found out the fastest way to get something charged just to plug it directly into an outlet. I plugged it into a USB hub I have and that didn't put enough juice out. At least not for the quick charge that it's capable of.
","
I thought this was a fast charging wireless pad but it's my fault for not reading. It works great though! I'm just shocked how long it takes to charge which is fine because I only charge my phone at night so there is no rush on it. Definitely like how thin it is and doesn't take up a lot of space like most pads do. It is very cute and simple which is a huge for me.
","
It’s very small and lightweight! I read the reviews so I knew it would be small but, it’s smaller than I expected. Not a bad thing because it’ll make it easier to carry when traveling!It’s sleek and shiny, the lights indicated shows whether it’s plugged in (green) and charging (blue). I haven’t tested it out how the lights will be in dark yet but I’m sure it won’t be too bright.I’m thinking of getting one for my mom as well and there’s lots of color options available, which is nice!One of the reasons why I ordered this!
","
Very stylish, fast, and easy to use. This wireless charger works perfectly with my Samsung s10. Finally a wireless charger with elegance! I bought mine for my desk, but I plan to pick up more for my kitchen and bedrooms. You can never have too many of these! And they'd look great anywhere, unlike some of the other plain and bulky ones you see from other manufacturers. This one is nearly half the thickness of a pen!
","
This little guy measures just over two inches in diameter. Delivers a fast charge to my iPhone XR. I have an Otterbox Defender (the big/thick one) on my iPhone and was a little skeptical due to its size it would be able to charge the XR. It did so without any problems. I'd recommend this highly for traveling also due its small/compact size. Natively has a lightning port but also came with an adapter to convert to a regular USB.
","
I loved it when I first opened it up, the color is pretty, it’s compact, and a simple design.However, it does not charge my phone well at all.I’ve had it lying on the charger for over 8 hours and it’s barely at 42% from 12% when I placed it on.I always make sure all apps are closed out at the end of the night, too, so there wasn’t anything running in the background. Its also necessary to remove the phone case so it’s in direct contact with the face of the charger, which it was the whole night.There really shouldn’t be any reason it wasn’t fully charged after 8 hours.I wanted to like this, but unfortunately the charging power makes it difficult to. I don’t recommend this product at all.
","
I've actually purchased two of these.  I bought one for myself to charge my new earbuds and liked it so much I now use it for my phone and bought one for my elderly mother because she was always complaining about her kids calling while her phone was on the charger and she'd have to unplug it to answer the call.  I like the charger, she loves it.  She no longer has to fight a cord and her phone is always charged.
","
The directions aren't great but the charger itself is a breeze. One thing to be aware of: there is no wall plug included.
","
Arrived at my house 48 hours later pluged it in and it worked beautifully. Green lights tell you it’s ready, and changes to blue when charging. Has a nice clean and slim look to it. When I hooked it up to a amp meter it actually charges 25% quicker with the case on versus just the phone laying on the charger I thought it would’ve been the other way around. Great product I will definitely tell my friends about it.
","
This is super cute and convenient. I work from my computer and always have this on the side. It's smaller than I expected, which is good for travel. The charging power is slower than your typical USB cable but it's still a great buy.
","
I got the white with gold rim. I was really skeptical because of the price but so far it’s working really great. I don’t have issues with phone placements. I just drop my iPhone in the center and it starts charging right away. I also have no issue with having a phone case on from Caseology. The only con was that the gold rim looked more rose gold-ish. Very satisfied.
","
It works well enough. It tends to get a little hot while charging but that's kind of expected I guess. There should be an option to turn off the lights when not using the charger.
","
Update 6/3/2020: Been working for a month now no issues. I have to say i am very impressed with this company that has gone out of its way to make this right.Update 05/01/2020:  New unit arrived - testing begins - stay tuned!Update 04/29/2020: The Seller contacted me wanting to make the transaction right and is sending a replacement. will update the review in a month or so when the new unit is in place.Original post:  Slick looking product. Using it with an iPhone 8+ After a few weeks it stopped working. The charging light blinks green and does not go to blue.
","
This is my first wireless charger I’ve ever had, but I love it. I got the pink one, and I just set my phone on top and away it goes! The indicator light is super convenient as well, it turns solid blue while charging the device, then turns solid green again when charging is complete, so you can’t overcharge! I’m definitely not going back to traditional charging now lol this is the way.
","
I really like the charger overall, the champagne color is beautiful. It’s not something that I lose all the time which is amazing because I lose everything. The only thing I don’t like (isn’t unique to this product alone) is that it has to be plugged in for you to use it. Apparently this is true of almost all wireless chargers so that’s not really a specific defect with this one.
","
The appearance is good-looking, the workmanship is fine, and the charging is convenient, but the charging speed is a bit slow.
","
I wanted to love this. I have a desktop lamp with a wireless charging platform for my wireless earbuds and it’s fantastically handy and I was hoping to repeat the success. You have to set your phone on this *just so* for the charging to actually happen, and even if that’s “operator error” it’s still a painfully slow process to charge. In the end, it’s easier to just use the charging cable.
","
I really love this cute little wireless charger; I ordered the rose gold color and it looks even better it person, so sleek! The charging capacity is a little slower than the standard super fast charging on the Note20 Ultra, but its still fairly quick and the convenience is unbeatable! It even charges my wireless earbuds!
","
I have a Galaxy 10 and after a couple of months in Florida I got a message that there was moisture in my phone and the charging cord would not work so I got the Tozo to charge my phone and it works great. I particularly like the light that comes on blue and turns green and stays on for a night light in the bathroom where I use it.
","
My wife just got an iphone XR which is our first phone to support wireless charging.  This looked small, sleek, cool LED lights, and would do the job so I bought it.  It is all of that.  I particularly like the way the top led section changes from green to blue when the phone is set right to charge, and then back to green when it is done charging. Considering buying more of them.
","
The product was packaged well and arrived quickly. I may update this review in the future, but for now the product works fine and looks great.They also request you write a review to activate a 1-year warranty on the product. Huh.
","
It’s nice and sleek looks just like photos and charges my phone great. The only problem I had is the customer service email only gets back to you every 24 hours, so you have to wait a really long time to get help. But they will go above and beyond when u need help.
","
If its not perfectly positioned it doesnt charge AT ALL. And forget about using the device while its “charging” on this thing!! — takes a REALLY long time to charge. But it looks super sleek & very cool. I do not reccomend it for travel as its too slow and not something to rely on while on the go.
","
This charger is a good design but charging takes longer.
","

 This wireless charger is as it is described durable and build to long last. I like its lightweight and thickness. But don't like glass surfaces the phone falls off then placed at the angle. Overall I'm satisfied with what I bought. Got annoyed with cables
","
I like the charger but a little disappointed that I have to take my phone out of the case to charge it. I have a thin phone case and it still won’t charge through it.
","
I have been using another brand of wireless charger but despite getting the charging indicator, my iPhone didnt always charge,  This was a big disappointment in the morning after thinking I had charged overnight.The Tozo unit has been absolutely reliable and looks terrific and very well priced.  A great buy,
","
Super easy to use and I love how sleek, thin and small it is. However the title and description are a little misleading. It is not wireless. The fact that your phone or device doesn't have any wires attached doesnt mean wireless, if the pad itself has to always be plugged in. They should've made it so the pad can be charged and then be able to charge your devices without ANY wires having to be connected.
","
I actually have two of these. I have a white one in my office and a black matte one in my bedroom. Both are so beautiful and are pleasing to look at. They are super convenient to use. Besides the initial cord to plugin, I don't have to worry about plugging in my phone all the time. Which is really just an inconvenience and tedious. But I love mine. They charge very well and are sufficient for my phone battery.
","
This charger is an improvement over the already great previous version I also own.  Thin and sturdy, it is great for travel.  Has worked flawlessly with every wireless charging device I've tried it on so far.  Only downsides are that the green LED is a little bright when in a dark room, and that it didn't come with a USB cord or outlet box.  Although, everyone has several of those laying around these days anyway.  All in all, a great wireless charging pad.
","
The magnet on this charger is way stronger than the official Apple charger.The charging speed appears to be the same as the Apple charger.5/5 Cheaper and better than the official Apple charger.
","
Works great good quality
","
I like this wireless charger.  Pretty color.  I got the rose gold.  Very thin, easy for traveling.  The charging power I would say is ok.  Not that fast.  But that doesn’t really bother me, because I just charge it over night when I’m sleeping.  And it grips the end table good, doesn’t slide around.  Would recommend!
","
This works great and I’m over all happy. The only thing I don’t really like is that there is 2 bright green neon lights illuminated all the time. They turn blue while charging. I ordered this because I thought it would be nice to have on a counter or table but I would like it much better if it wasn’t always illuminated. I’ve had this for months and so far it works very well and connects to my phone easily. I feel like it charges fast too.
","
It looks very sleek and is great to toss my Tozo headphones or iPhone on in between use, but it is a slow charge, so don’t think it’ll be a savior for a dying phone.
","
Love the size.  But be forewarned...it charges painfully slow.  Not super fast charge. Not fast charge. Not even charge.  They should name the last mode ""turtle"".  Went up 8% in about 30 minutes.
","
I love this charger!  I wanted something for our communal space, where you could just pop your phone down, no matter what phone you have, and let it charge. But it was important that it went with our decor. This charger is beautiful, stunning and sleek! The high gloss surface does not impede the phone from charging or making it fall off. It also charges through my case, and I have a little detail on the back of my case that does not affect the connection. I bought this charger based on  the great reviews from other customers.
","
This is not truly wireless. The charger must be plugged into the computer or the wall for it to charge your phone. I thought you could charge the disc and the use the disc to charge your phone-not the case. I can just use my phone charger that’s plugged into my computer or on my desk. No need for this.
","
It's a great way to avoid having to plug in my S21 Ultra if I don't want to. I typically put life proof cases on my phone so I usually have port covers to keep dirt out so if I don't have to take those out I'm all for it! Great product for the price point especially since I also have the Rozo t6 earbyds which also charge via the pad.
","
You just set the phone on top of the charger, the green light changes to blue to let you know that it's charging. Nothing could be easier. I always hated when I'd pick up my phone and find out the next morning that it hadn't charged. When the light turns green, it's charged. The light is bright enough to find in the dark, but not bright enough to keep you awake or even be aware of at night. Very sleek, nice looking on your nightstand.
","
This wireless charger is super thin, looks like a coaster. Because it is made of aluminum, heat dissipation is good, keeping your phone relatively cool while charging. Because of its slim design, it does not take up a lot space, so ideal for taking to places if you travel much. Easy to use, just plug in your usb-c charging cable and drop your device (e.g. your TOZO wireless earbuds storage box) on. Charging speed is not the fastest but it gets the job done and does it well.
","
Don’t get my rating wrong it’s a good device, it just takes forever to charge my iPhone XR. But all in all it’s very sleek and beautifully designed. Doesn’t take up much space and it just doesn’t charge to the speed expected.
","
I love this charger. It has a sleek look and the pink is cute. The charging light is a little bright, so be warned if you are a sleeper who is sensitive to light.
","
Very nice cheap ($12) charger. Charges well through thin and thick phone cases (Otter). It Does work when plugged into a computer (read a review that said it didn’t).
","
I love this Tozo charger, it charges fast and it is super convenient. No more thumbing with a USB cable. Just set the phone on it and move on.  It also charges all of my Tozo earbuds. I know there are other brands of wireless chargers but no one stands behind their products like TOZO does!  For my wireless needs its TOZO.
","
This is the second TOZO product I have ordered and am extremely happy with the results.The wireless charger is very thin and the footprint is about the size of a coaster. It feels like a quality product and for the price you can add one to every room.They come in 7 different colors and the contact surface is non slip so you don't accidentally bump your device off of the charger.Do yourself a favor and get one or three.
","
I dig this little charger. I was concerned it might not be compatible with my phone, but no problems there. Seems to charge at about the same speed as the plug-in alternative. It's not as bulky as the cradle style wireless charger, I just need to constantly remind myself it's not a coaster! But wouldn't that be cool?...
","
Charger worked pretty flawlessly for the first several months I had it, then just stopped one day. Customer service was pretty easy to work with, asked if I had tried some basic troubleshooting steps before sending a replacement. Will update when replacement comes in!
","
El producto es fácil de usar. Se ve muy bonito. El color le da una estética perfecta a mi escritorio. El único problema es que el poder de carga es muy bajo. Prefiero conectar mi cable de iPhone y conectarlo a mi ordenador. Sin embargo, si no deseas usar cables y quieres darle un toque tecnológico a tu escritorio, es una buena compra.
","
Really enjoy this, its sleek design is beautiful, the lights are a neat touch and a part of its look.  It durability is something I havent been able to notice, its extremely thin so I am a little on edge, and its edge looks to be aluminum but not flimsy, I am worried about the glass? It looks like glass anyway on top, which would ruin any durability tests, really hope it's some sort of polymer instead of glass, but it's a cheap wireless charger and I am happy with it. I think you would be too.
","
Have only had it a week or so. Not the fastest way to charge, but small, light and attractive. Just need to put my phone down, pay attention that heard the charging “ding” and walk away. Can’t give it a five until i see how long it lasts.
","
Charged ok and not bad speed but my phone would get extremely hot while charging and everyone knows that is bad for your battery.  I did not have that problem with the apple magsafe though the cost was more than twice the price of this charger.  I bought a charging stand at the same time as this and was disappointed that the charger was a millimeter too big to fit. I ended up returning this and just use the apple charger only.  It’s possible that this will work great for other phones but didn’t work for me,
","
This is so pretty and It works like a charm! I really love the rose gold color and the glass white top. I also love that I won’t accidentally pull the charger out of the wall if I need to check my phone in the middle of the night. Now I want one to use on my desk at work!The green lights change to blue when the phone is charging. I even have a phone case with a kickstand, and the charger still works perfectly.
","
Worked great for my ear buds!!! I just set the case in there and they charge quickly but did not work for my cellphone! It said charging but the charge never increased even when left over night!
","
This is a great charging pad! And don’t forget to get the quick charging adapter as they work great together to quickly charge your devices and can charge multiple devices at once! It even works for charging our iPhone 8 Plus with the phone cover on which is hard to find! It’s only big enough to fit one device at a time, but the adapter has two plugins where we can charge two devices quickly. Highly recommend especially if your short on battery and time! Two thumbs up!!
","
previous wireless charging base had broke so i needed to get a replament. was looking for something on the cheaper side but was concerned would not work properly. Went with this model and i have no complaints.QC charging works like a charm, please be aware the adapter is not included with charger. the charger itself is so nice and slim. really like this too as there is no bright lights all over it when its charger or not. just one little LED. Great Job especially with the the price point.Thanks
","
It is not a fast charger.  So, for the price paid, on sale, I will not complain.  It is small and slim.  I have a large phone and have to lay it down just right or it would not charge.
","
I love how thin it is. It’s perfect for traveling.
","
Got this for my boyfriend, so far it works well. Hoping he won’t mistake it for a coaster in the middle of the night. Comes with a short page of obvious instructions in 6 different languages and a year-long warranty. A little smaller than I imagined, but I also didn’t read the description before ordering, so that one’s on me. Still not sure what the colors of the lights indicate, but I’ll figure it out. 7/10 I suppose.
","
If you have a compatible phone this is a must. Overcharging your phone cause cause long term problems and cause you to have to constantly buy new phones as the batteries are constantly being burnt out. This charger is a smart-charger of sorts as it automatically shuts off which is extremely essential if you need your phone charged for the morning of which I myself can be absent minded of and forget to charge at times. Overall love the product.
","
Good build quality, feels like it’s made of sturdy materials. It has a non-slip coating and strong magnets that hold it to my fridge tightly.The charging speed is as good as you can expect for a wireless charger and will vary depending on the thickness of your case. Using a 5V 2.4A charger it charged my phone at half the rate of a cable with no case on, and 1/4 the rate through a medium thickness case.

 Its thin, sleek and elegant and yet provides a fast charge. We bought the white/gold color. We love the light on the plate. Its perfect when its dark and watching a movie. simply place it on the pad and the light changes from green to blue. No need to worry about moving the phone to charge it while on pad. Great product. Very stylish. You will need to make sure you purchase a fast charge (3.0) adapter.I have added a video to show how thin it is and how it easily charges a phone with a thick case, simply elegant and amazing.
","
The charging pad itself must be plugged in for it to charge a phone, otherwise it's just a nice looking coaster.
","
This is a super slim charger. It’s charging power is good. I was worried the first couple of nights bc it wouldn’t charge my iPhone 8 Plus and I realized it’s because I had a metal plate for my car magnate. Once I took the metal plate off the charger works great. Obviously it’s not as fast as an iPad charger wired but it’s super convenient to use so i enjoy it a lot
","
I like that this charger is compact for traveling, and easy to just toss your phone onto. However, it takes my phone much longer to charge with this than it does when I use my regular lightning cable.
","
I love this wireless charger, but there are times its charging my phone (indicated by the blue light on the charger and charging symbol on my phone), but several hours later, my phone is not completely charged and the charger has only maintained (not increased) the charge over those several hours. This has only happened on occasion, but frustrating since I usually charge my phone overnight and when I wake up, its not charged.
","
Very nice little charger. Works well and charges fast. The only downside is that it is slick as my phone and Ihave a lot of trouble keep my phone from sliding of the charger. I have to hold it down with a rubber band. I think would buy it again anyway.
","
Love the color, wish it changed colors lime some of the others state. But I love not having to plug my phone up and just need to make sure I have it on the charger correctly otherwise it will not charge.
","
It’s supper cute and stays on my dresser but it’s finicky on charging. I put my phone on it before I go to bed I make sure the charging lights are on and everything. But sometimes it stops charging during the night and other times it charges just fine. I’m not sure if it’s all of them or just the one I got doing that so I might get another one to compair it to.
","
Doesn't charge through 10mm as Advertised
","
It works great and looks great but I wish there was a way to turn off the indicator lights. They’re too bright to be next to the bed at night
","
I'm pleased with the charger.  Works great with my Galaxy S22 Ultra.
","
The most beautiful construction I've seen. But the magnets in my iPhone case confused the charger so it didn't charge my phone. I need the magnet case so my son is enjoying this charger. Really nice rubberized top, feet, and anodized edges.
","
This is my first wireless charger. I really like it. It’s lightweight, pretty, and charges my things. I probably misread the description - I was under the impression that I could charge the charger and take it with me almost like a back up battery - but that is not the case. However, it is slim enough it is easy to pack and take with you.
","
Been shopping around and finally found one good looking charger. Plus it looks really good on my night stand. Just like others have mentioned cool looking light indicator. I really like the light indicator it’s so neat. I kind of wish it came with a charging block now I have to buy one or find one around the house. It’s not the big of a deal but I love this charger. I got the rose gold color and I absolutely love it !! Definitely recommend.
","
I really like the look and size of the product. It also charges through fairly thick cases. I wish the light turned off when not in use or after short period of time while in use but not a dealbreaker. The feet wobble a tiny bit on flat surfaces which is only mildly annoying but then again you usually just put your phone on it and leave. Happy with the purchase.
","
Only used a couple times so far, but overall fairly pleased! Was surprised to find out that it's still charged my Motorola edge Plus even through a case and popsocket if positioned well. I don't use the pad for fast charging, but it's excellent for overnight charging and putting less strain on the battery, since it only charges the phone at the 5 Watts for certain phones.

 IT DOES NOT CHARGE!!!I’m not sure if it’s because I purchased the one that has the least reviews or what. But this charger does not charge at all! I put my phone to charge during the day and when I went to set my phone on the wireless charger it would charge on and off it was very annoying because all I would hear is the on and off charging sounds. I decided to take off my phone case to see if that was a problem, but it’s shouldn’t have been because my phone case is very thin. (I’ll insert picture) with out my phone case it would charge for about 2 minutes or so and after that it would go back to not charging and I’d have to go and move it around.During the night I decided to give it another try and see how much it would charge. I left it on for about 6 hours. My phone was at 7% when it began to charge, this morning I go to reach my phone and it is at 27%I am very much disappointed given that I have been putting a lot of faith into this brand. I have bought other items from Tozo and have been great for my family and I.Though I would say do not waste your money on this item, or if you are make sure you have a back up charger for your phone.
","
Samsung 8 plus. Has to be face up to charge so notification light can be seen flashing at night.  I have to cover it. When charging, blue light is pretty bright. Always a green light on when plugged in. Easy, convenient,  fast charge.
","
I thought the price for this wireless charger was too good to be true, and it is. It does charge, but it takes so long it isn't even worth using. The biggest issue with this charger is the light though. When you put your phone on it, it lights up so bright that I can't fall asleep if I charge overnight.
","
Looks great but was disappointed when I tried to charge my iPhone 12 w/case still on. I had to take from the case so it would charge!  Very inconvenient for me to do every time I need to charge the phone.

I got this when I ordered there ear buds. I have to say this charger is GREAT. I can not only charge my new ear buds but also my android phone and even my husband I phone on this. Great product Great price. I ended up ordering a second for my husband.
","
The charging pad works very quickly, but i haven't been able to pair it with anything but my ear buds. I've tried every way possible, even went back download instructions and did research to see if there was something i was doing wrong. Followed all instructions, still no luck. For me, without it changing my phone, it's a big waste, if not for it charging my ear buds, i would have sent it back for a refund.
","
The connection between the charger and the unibody is miserable. Keeps falling out, and when it does stay in, if you shift in the chair next to the end table where it's charging, it'll disconnect.  I cannot pick up the phone and return it to the unibody without the unibody losing cconnection and needing to wiggle the wire charger back into connecting. So two problems. The charger falls out of the port at the merest movement. The times it doesn't fall out, the charger disconnects and I have to push it back and move it around til it lights up again. I have 5.00  glow in the dark USB chargeable collars for my dogs that have a more secure connection when they're charging, both physically and electronically. I don't know if the problem is with the wire charger or the port in the unibody - I suspect the port. Really, is so much money saved by skimping on quality with that part?Since it does work if I stay absolutely still, I'm keeping it.  Too many Amazon returns recently and I'm tired of making the trip to the USPS drop off.
","
I've owned a factory Samsung version and it was about $50. This one does the same thing for a fraction of the cost.
","
Nice and thin.  Matt black for use in a car that does not come with wireless charging.  I used this in conjunction with the AAWireless Android device to have fully cable free Android in a can that did not come with wireless Android.
","
I recently got an iPhone 12 Pro Max and I was looking to get a wireless charger but couldn’t decide which one. I bought this TOZO W6 magnet wireless charger and I love it. It is compact, charges fast, very strong magnet, great for traveling, easy to use and compatible for Apple products. I love TOZO products, screen protectors and cases. I will definitely will be buying a couple more mag chargers for my daughter and husband.
","
Tried this item because it was a flash deal and I love it works great
","
It's a very slow charge - mainly it just keeps the battery from draining. I use the phone regularly throughout the day and my phone has a fairly full charge if I keep it on the charger. I used to drain the battery rapidly due to heavy use. If you need a rapid charge - use a standard plugin charger.
","
The pros of this charger are it's simplicity and form factor.I also very much appreciated the customer service.I ran into an issue where it wasn't compatible with my phone's fast charging, but I've since given it to a friend who can make better use of it. They are happy!  And Tozo was very fair with their resolution of the issue.
","
The Tozo W6 is a tiny wonder. Its magnet makes it hug tight to my iPhone 12 while doing a great job charging. Because of the magnet's tight grip, this charger stays in place and works great in the car. It's sooo simple to just set my phone on this tiny disc instead of constantly plugging and unplugging the USB-C cable. The W6 works great with its convenient and versatile USB attachment. I'm very happy with this device.
","
I know, I know, how hard is it to plug in a phone?  But I still love that this makes my life easier - a pretty little lit up circle reminding me to charge my phone and all I need to do is drop it on. The light changes from green to blue so I know it's charging, back to green when it's 100%, and I don't have to try and get that little tiny plug into the little tiny hole. I'm happy.
","
This charger is fantastic! It looks great and works well. I was worried that the LEDs might be too bright at night but they're just right.  You almost can't see them from the side (i.e. when you're lying in bed) but they're plenty bright enough from above, even in the daylight.You can see from the pictures that the charger is thinner than my iPhone X with a slim case.  I was surprised at how quickly my phone makes its ""I'm charging"" sound after I put the phone on this charger.  Other Qi chargers I've tried take noticeably longer.Overall, I'm very happy with this charger and would certainly recommend it to my friends.
","
I was initially skeptical about getting a wireless charging because the one I currently have is slow and stops charging in the middle.  After seeing this listed as fast charging capable and the price, I gave wireless charging another shot. I'm glad I did because this Tozo W1 is sleek and solid..it doesn't look cheap and it's working great. Does fast charging even through my bulky phone case. Highly recommend it.
","
Unit includes non-skid underneath. :-)Cord is great length for top of desktop or nightstand, but will barely reach longer distances (from ground or standard outlet height).You need the higher 2A (5B) ""block"" for this to work. The cord connectors are USB type-A to USB type-C - not sure why this isn't clearer in the description/pictures.
","
Just received this product and it works great! I got the white version and it's very stylish and looks great on my side table. The light does not disturb my sleep and it automatically stops trying to charge my phone once it reaches 100%. I wouldn't say it is a fast charger even though I have it plugged into a fast charge wall adapter, so I'll being using it as my overnight charger and will have to buy a different one for actual ""fast"" charging.
","
This is the first quality charger I purchased that resembles the design of an iPhone. The quality of the construction is super. I like the side lights that light up when the charger is on and when it is in use. Fast charging is also a plus on this charger. The input port uses USB-C, so you can see the designers made this product to be as future-proof as much as possible. The charger's small size also makes it convenient for use when travelling or at work. Highly recommended overall.
","
This charger is awesome and charges my phone with its case on and earbuds with the case.....a lot better than I expected. I am very happy to buy this charger so that I ordered one more for my son. It deserves more than 5 stars.
","
I would've given this a 5 star except that the light stays on always,  never goes out.  Annoying when you trying to sleep.
","
This wireless charger is cute, sleek and works great! I have another wireless charger that has to have the phone placed just right or it won’t charge..this charger does not do that!
","
This is the 3rd one of these type of chargers I've purchased.  I did not like one I bought that was thick and black. This one has a pleasing appearance and will not be an unwelcome addition to where ever you decide to station it.  I like that my iPhone 10 allows me to rest it on the charger and will maintain a 100% charge while the phone is just sitting there. I also like that it looks elegant and very flat. It also has two very thin green semi circle lights  on two edges (easy to see) that turn blue when iPhone is detected and charging begins. I may order several more of these for other locations in my home.
","
I thought it did fast charging but it does only 3.5 hours of charging. I didn't know you had to buy a fast charging cable. If I knew I wouldn't have bought it. It just leads to costing more in the end... but it does charge. Just not fast unfortunately
","
These things look amazing... super sleek, aesthetically *chefs kiss*. However, you cannot just place a phone on it and have it charge. There are nice little lights that change from Green to Blue when a phone is docked on it, but dont be fooled, that does not mean that it is charging! A few too many times I have woken up thanks to my husband's alarm clock because my phone died over night while ""charging"". You need to meticulously place the phone on the charger and make sure it clearly says ""charging"" and for the love of god and all things holy, do NOT check your phone real quick, even the slightest touch could be the end of an other wise productive morning...

 TOZO Wireless Charger is a very thin and sleek design for wireless charging.  Low profile wireless charger with an aesthetically pleasing style.  The TOZO charger produced similar charging, at 700-800 mA, compared to my ""Fast Charge"" wireless charger which produced 750-850 mA.  I did have a compatibility issue when connecting to my laptop USB port.  The TOZO charger cycled through charging & pausing, most likely due to my computer not recognizing the device.
","
Stays charged while I’m walking on the treadmill watching some shows. Better yet it stays in my ear all that time. All I need it for presently.
","
The product works as intended, howver I think it can only be used for the earbuds and no other product or a phone or something, this makes it kind of not worth the purchase.
","
This simple yet elegant wireless charger was everything I was looking for. I was trying to find a wireless charger that would be within a good price range but is effective and this one really was it! It’s even super pretty and looks super pretty on my side table. I would definitely want to recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless charger. I’m happy that it’s heat and over charging protected and that I do not need to worry about my phone heating up since it stops charging at 100%. Very great product indeed.
","
Works great! Love the color! The only part that can be a little tricky is laying it down on the charger. I have a fairly big phone so if I just throw it down it might not charge. But placing it down carefully and making sure the light turns blue means it’s charging and all is well. It’s really not a big deal, and I still enjoy the convenience of it.
","
This has worked ery well wirelessly charging the t10's and a S10.  Does not get overly warm.  I do recomend bying their latest model to stay as current as posible
","
This was a really sleek looking charger and worked great but after only 2 months of use it died. It doesn't power on at all anymore even with trying different cables. Dissapointing because it worked so well initially!
","
I use this to charge my iPhone X and it works very well!  It's not super fast, but it is reliable and I have used it every day since I received it.  I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter.  She likes hers too.  I like mine so much that I am getting a second one for myself.  I definitely recommend this product.
","
So far so good it charges my iPhone pretty well. I’m not of sure if I noticed it charging faster than the iPhone charger, but it’s a good product
","
After using in for about 30 minutes it charges decently. About 1% per minute. When I set my phone on it it didn't initially charge. Then I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and it worked.
","
works great with out hassle of dirty port. not as fast charging but great for over night or next to your television chair
","
I have a Iphone 8+ and this charger works well with my phone. I used to have a wireless charger and it would make my phone very hot while charging. I was skeptical about getting another wireless charger, but this one seems to be working well. I also use a thin rubber phone case and it charges through the case perfectly fine.This item looks good, nice and sleek, and the LED charging indicators seem to be working perfectly. I've only had the product for a few days, will update if anything changes.
","
It's definitely a good looking charging pad; thin and black.The LED lights turn on (green) when it's plugged in.  The LEDs flash purple and blue when charging.It works great on Iphone SE, 11, and 13; even with a thin plastic covers
","
Because my teens are so needy they used this charger on their iPhones (8 & X )before I did on my Samsung Note 8. They are constantly losing their chargers and this being in my WFH office made them poot their phones down. Looks good too.
","
Compared with the other 2 wireless chargers I have, this charger is much thinner and it has a much larger surface. The mirror panel on the surface also looks great. One minor thing the manufacture can improve is to mention the meaning of different led statuses in the user manual (it may be obvious after using it for a while, but new user may still be confused).
","
slow charging for phone
","
Was tired of always trying to plug the cord into the bottom of my phone and was worried that I might damage it and end up having to buy a new phone but now with this wireless charger I can just lay it on top of the charger and it charged and I won't do any damage to the phone charger on the bottom what a great idea love this product got another one for home and got one for a housemate.
","
I bought this device hoping I could charge my phone wirelessly at home and on the go however I can not. Though your phone is able to sit on top and charge w/out a cord .. the device it self still needs to be plugged into power. So it really just looks cool is all.Needless to say I’m annoyed and wish I would’ve saved my money. I can plug in my phone w/a regular charger and get a better charge.
","
Pros: sleek, slim, and compact. Light indicators are subtle yet noticeable. I ordered 4 of the white ones. Works with my waterproof case on (iPhone XR).Cons: does not work if you have a magnet on back. Charge cord is pretty short maybe 2.5 ft. No charge block included.
","
Compatible with iPhone and IPad, also the Android phone that my better half owns, charging speed is about double the time of plugging in directly; But heck sometimes you just feel like being lazy! Go ahead and buy this.
","
Great charger, it takes a a little longer then a regular fast charger to charge but that's obvious. It works for Apple and Android and the watches as well. So good investment.
","
This is a great, cost effective charger.  I knew it would be on the smaller side, but I was still blown away! It's literally the size of my palm and thin as can be. That does not hinder the power behind it, though. Within an hour, I went from 2%to 50%, and my mobile holds the charge. I also used this for my Galaxy Buds+ and they charged well!Definitely look into the warranty! (:
","
These are great for night charges by the bed.  Leave it overnight and fully charged in the morning.The only minimal bad note on this is if the battery % is close to 0, or dead, you need to use a regular plug in cord to get the charge to 8-10%, then it can go back on this charging disc.
","
Amazing
","
Was skeptical at first but as soon as I got it, I tried it and it really is a fast charger. It charged through my Note 10+ phone case so that sold me. I'm waiting to see how long it lasts. I had to leave a review because I really like it and it comes in diff colors but for the first time I chose something in tech other than black and white.
","
Easy to use, I don’t have to worry about plugging my phone in while I’m half asleep, just gotta put it down on the charger and it works perfectly, also don’t have to pull my case off to charge it which is nice.. haven’t used it for traveling so I wouldn’t know how good it is for that
","
This charger worked and charged pretty quickly, then it died.  It lasted about 1 month.  It lights up solid green when on standby, then solid blue when charging.  When it died, the light was a flashing green light.
","
I love the color and how sleek it is!
","
I use this on my desk at work I love how minimalist this looks.
","
Works great. Doesn’t charge as fast as I would like but it’s great to have next to my computer while working!
","
It charges your device, yes. However, the cord has to be plugged into both the charger and the wall. It doesn’t always get a connection so they added this bright green light so you know when it is plugged in and charging. That bright green light then lights up your bedroom at night. So annoying!
","
When open it I was surprise it. Tiny, slim and incredibly pro finish.  Works perfect with my fast charger ( it's onky with a cable but is logicaln use yours)  charge similar that my cable and works with my tozo 12 earbuds and my galaxy smartphone too.  The only think is like every wieless charger, make sure you put your smartphone just in the middle or doesn't charge.5 stars. Nice wireless charger
","
Beautiful design and works flawlessly. The LEDs are always on which becomes an issue if your fiancee hates vampire lights at night. Wish I could turn them off. I just unplug when not in use.
","
First let me say, I love that I don’t need to plug my phone in, I can just lay it on this disk and it will charge. Doesn’t take up too much space and it’s easy to use. My problem is the charging capabilities... not sure if I got a defective one (I’m replacing the one I have) but it takes FOREVER to charge and even then it never charges my iPhone 11 or my tozo wireless earbuds to 💯% ...some could argue ur iPhone or earbuds are old but they were both purchased this month. I love the fact that I can charge both items on this disk, but I’m sure other brands can do the same and charge faster and more effectively. I will try the replacement, hopefully I just got a wonky defective one but if not I’ll try another brand.
","
First off let me just say that the build quality of this charger is impeccable. I use this to charge my TOZO T12 earbuds wireless through their case and it is quite nice and reliable. It is quite small and that comes in handy for travel purposes and it fits nicely on my computer desk. I don't have an iPhone 12 to use the fancy magnet feature but otherwise, it's a solid product..
","
Cute. Small. Thin. Superfast charging. I love it!
","
This unit seems to work just fine. I do not know why someone needs a +$50 brand-name device to do the some thing. This is nice and sleek. I give it a lower rating for travel since it uses a USB-C cable... yet another USB type to carry. USB-C is high data transfer connection and totally unnecessary for charging. Most devices of this type use a micro-USB cable or a ""fixed"" cable.
","
Update - 5 months in and no problems at all. We do have faster wireless chargers out there now, but a good buy nonetheless.While I have a few wireless chargers at home and office, this one by far is the best looking of the lot. I bought this for my office desk after buying the Airpods Pro and needed a cheap wireless charger. The Tozo was on sale and came at a reasonable price.So far, I've not been disappointed. The charger has been working as described, but it's early days just yet.Will post an update on final words in a few months.Overall - I dont regret the purchase (yet) :)
","
All I can say is that this wireless charger is impressive all the way from the packaging it came in to the wireless charger itself. It literally beautiful on my nightstand next to my bed. It's definitely worth the price they are asking and I can't believe they even sell it so low as they do. It's definitely not plastic and it glows an amazing green on the charging plate until you put your phone on it or your earbuds charging case and then it'll turn blue. I will be getting more of these for the house. Also it charges my Pixel 3XL very fast which I honestly did not expect. Do I recommend this companies products???? I HIGHLY recommend this companies products.
","
Works like its supposed to but sometimes it doesn't start charging right away, takes a couple seconds to connect to the phone. My otter box case might have something to do with that though.
","
It’s good charger. Works well for iPhone 11 Pro. It’s just not rose gold; it’s pink. I ordered one from the same manufacturer last year and is a very nice pale rose gold (although in the pic it just looks gold next to the new pink one). This one is pink and not my style.It’s fine and not worth returning, but I wouldn’t have ordered it if I knew and was hoping it would be a consistent style throughly the home to have multiple charging areas.
","
The product works great!! I thought it wouldn’t work on my IPhone 12 but luckily it did. However, it isn’t as fast as I thought it would be. You have to buy a separate charger for that. Other than that, super good buy!
","
It's good for charging overnight
","
Lovely thin sliver on my desk  - useless as it did not work out of the box.  Light came on, phone drained away.  Bought a different style - eyesore but charges quickly and that's the point.
","
I've had many products from Tozo and this is my 2nd wireless charger from this company. I used this charger for my earbuds and my iPhone and it works flawlessly. The W6 charger is well-built, compact and lightweight enough to be carried around in my backpack. The only con is it connects to the power brick via a USB-C connector instead of USB-A so I had to order one but otherwise it works fine. I highly recommend this product!!
","
Purchased as a gift for grandson Christmas,  unsure  the functioning and durable
","
Just plug it in, place your device on it and watch the rings go from green to blue! Charged my husband's months-dead Samsung in a surprising amount of time.And my son left his substantial phone case on his iPhone and it charged it as well. That was really nice! Taking your case off and on is such a pain in the behind.The slim disc design is pretty spiffy as well. I hate cords and chargers everywhere. This is just perfect to get rid of all that!
","
Amazing, sleek little charger! This thing is SUPER easy to use, just plug it in, lay the device on it and let 'er rip!! The LED lights that change color are very useful so there's no question in the status. Doesn't charge my phone as fast as the factory charger that came with it, but that is by no means a deal breaker. Thinking of ordering more!
","
This thing is great. It is much more slim than all the other wireless chargers we have used, you can easily tuck it away on a counter. It is also able to get through a thick OtterBox case with no issues unlike some others we have owned. Not to mention the 20W charging is fantastic. This is well worth the money!
","
I’m a big fan of these little things. They are discrete with a little bit of flashiness to them. They blend in with regular house furnishings but also have a subtle tech vibe from their LEDs. The chamfered edges are reminiscent of the classic iPhone 5 design. After buying the first couple I got 4 or 5 more, to sit alongside beds and couches throughout the house.
","
Just got this today. It looks really nice and also is Qi certified according to the wireless power consortium. So far I've only either found cheap looking Qi certified chargers or good looking but non certified once that just stop working at some point with new devices.This one looks really good and has a great haptic to it. I'll probably am going to order a couple more of these and make these the ones I have scattered around my apartment. They fit in nicely and can be placed in the living room or other places without drawing attention or looking like a cheap gadget.
","
I have bought 9 in total for gifts and they were big hits with my grand kids I keep one on my work desk. They charge quick and no pulling of a cord to unplug .
","
We love the quality of Tozo products. Both our devices can be charged wirelessly. Iphone 8, Samsung Note 9. We were using a generic dual use wireless charger, usb with charging dock. This gorgeous wireless charger will join the nightstand charging power juice. It charges our iphone 8 from low-100% just above 1.75 hours. Note 9 a shade under that. Thank you Tozo for another quality product to go with my Tozo NC9 wireless earbuds with ANC, that also perform phenomenally!
","
Requiring a written review causes me to just cancel the review - all other reviews in this list will be cancelled
","
This charger is convenient for those who do not have an overly thick case or a PopSocket on the back of their phone case.  The phone must lay flat on the charger, face-up.  The charging light changes color so you can see charging status.  It's a great idea to be able to place your phone on it and not have to continually fiddle with a lightning cord, which wears out due to the constant plugging/unplugging.  I am hoping this charger will save me in replacement cables.
","
This product does what it promises on the tin: it charges your phone wirelessly. But you can't just set your phone down, you have to make sure it's in the exact right spot. It's fun to try out but ultimately slower, more restrictive, and less convenient than using a corded charger. And if you are getting a wireless charger, pick one that isn't so easy to place your device ""incorrectly"" on.
","
NO photo
","
This is a pretty color. But it charges maybe 70% of the time. Then it shuts itself down. Would not recommend.
","
I really liked the color and how simple it is to use but charging literally takes forever. My phone would only go up a few percentages. Wouldn't recommend if you're searching for something that's fast charging.
","
This is an excellent wireless charger. Plug it in, put your device on top, and it’s charging. I’ve charged my Tozo T10 Wireless Earbuds (also excellent, BTW) and my iPhone XR (in a Tech21 case). Works great. I got the gray version. Instead of lighting up on the pad, there is an LED on the front that changes color. This is a good option for those who want to charge at night and not be bothered by the brighter lights on the top of the pad. I uploaded a photo. You can see that my TozoEarbuds have are charging (the blue light on the front of the charger). It changes to green when nothing is charging.
","
Bought this charger for my Galaxy Note 20 5G Ultra and it is amazing. Obviously, wirless chargers are slower than cable charging but the ease this charger provides is astonishing for my busy lifestyle. I just place my phone on top and forgot it. No need to mess around with cables or trying to connect your phone. I had trouble at night plugging my old phone in that I scratched it. I'm not allowing that to happen again with my expensive new phone. Great product. Highly recommend.
","
This charger is a very good product . I damaged my charging port on my iPhone 11 accidentally an decided to give this a try . I received it in less than 24 hours an simply plugged it in a laid the phone on it . It has beautiful and calming lighting . It charges very well an even better if you remove your bulky phone cover/protector .
","
This is a great charger!  Just bought an IPhone 12 and needed a new wireless charger.  This one turned out to be a great choice.  It’s nice looking and has a thin profile.  Very easy to use, put the phone down and it’s almost a instant connection. You could easily use this for traveling because of the small size and thinness of the charging plate.  Definitely a great charger.
","
Very nice product
","
Really well made and just as sturdy as the add sounds. Super portable and even works with some of the thicker cases.
","
I adore this little charger. I got the pink version and it looks very pretty on the desk. Side and bottom are shiny metal. The top is a rubbery, foamy material. I've owned it for one month. It picked up my phone right away and charges very quickly. Came with its own USB-C to USB cable (white). If I need another one, I'll definitely buy this one again.
","
Received this item the end of January for my daughters iPhone 12 she loved it and it worked with all her cases on it to charge. It for some reason would not charge my iPhone 11 though. Item stopped working the other day in early June. So it worked for about 5 months and doesn’t work anymore and item says it is not eligible for return or refund :-( - so wish it lasted a little longer or could at least get it swapped out
","
I like it, but only one tiny complaint. The lights! Oh my gosh. I’m one of those people who can’t have any lighting when I’m asleep and the bright blue/green lighting kept me up all night! I’ve put duct tape over the lighting to see if that’ll help. I would use regular charging cords, but my phone won’t let that happen anymore for some reason. But other than that lighting situation, it’s great!
","
This thing looks amazing. It's made from real glass and metal.This Tozo Wireless Charger is also really REALLY thin. It's thinner than an iPhone.Oh and it wirelessly charges an iPhone xs max perfectlyThe only thing I could see being an issue is taking it traveling. Since it is made from real glass, shattering could be an issue. Although it seems to be toughened/hardened glassGreat product. Would recomment
","
Don’t waste your money.  Takes hours and hours to even get 50% charge on phone.
","
I purchased the rose gold/white wireless charger. It feels sturdy and is very sleek looking. It goes great with my other desk accessories. I like how the lights change when it's charging so you know the phone is positioned correctly. The packaging was also pretty cool. I'll probably end up getting another one! Just a heads up, it doesn't come with the wall plug part, just the USB cord.
","
slim, sleek and functional.am using this at the office where i have to attend many meetings.  having the ability to  put down my phone and start it charging, then pick up and walk away easily is a game changer for me.
","
I have always been quite skeptical of these types of chargers. However, the result has been shocking. My mobile device (Iphone 11) gets a full charge in 43 minutes. Besides, there is the convenience of not having to connect the telephone to electricity. Simply placing it on top of the wireless charger is enough. It also incorporates an adapter for the new USB connectors. Aesthetically, the charger is also impressive.
","
It's been awesome so far!! Works great with my Pixel 5. Love the convenience of not having to plug my phone in to charge it. I can just set it down and soon it's ready to go! Also, the indicator lights were a nice touch. I was worried they'd be too bright in my room at night, but my phone blocks the light when it's on the charger so it doesn't bug me at all!
","
I have a thin case with a thin piece of metal on the back to attach to a magnetic phone holder. It will not charge. I have to remove the case in order for it to work. At that point there's no convenience to use the charger. Might as well plug it in.  Who doesn't use phone cases?  2 stars because it does technically work, But I have no reason to recommend it.
","
I was looking around for my first wireless charger purchase and after looking at quite a few on Amazon, I decided on this TOZO wireless charger. I can say that I am happily delighted with my purchase, especially because I don’t have to tap on my phone to see whether or not it is charging (the charger side lights change from green to blue when charging a device). I am yet to test how quickly it charges but all that’s important to me is that when I put it on the charger at night, even if it is under 10%, it is at 100% in the morning (about 7 hours of sleep for me, usually). Great customer service, too!
","
OK charger. It was a good deal for the price.  Call Dale it doesn’t work with older model phones. I have a iPhone 12 and an iPhone 11 and they charge with cheese. But my older iPhone 6s and Android galaxy that charger didn’t recognize.  I wish to charge it came with it USB adapter. Fortunately I had a spare.
","
Muy sencillo de usar
","
I go through traditional charges super quick as the wire always tends to only work in a certain position after a couple of months . I decided to try a wireless charger so I could have something reliable overnight. It came super quick and all you have to do is open the package, peel off the film and plug it in. It feels light but also solid and it’s very attractive. I like how it the color changes when your phone is being charged. Overall, it’s been super easy to set up and start using which is what I needed!

*Fast delivery**Very convenient* *VERY BEUTIFUL* * lightweight* Love that have the feature when you put your phone to charge turn lights blue, I don’t know if has happened to you the you put you phone “to charge” and when you go back hasn’t change because you didn’t put it right? So thanks that turn a blue light I know its charging!!! Love how I can connect to my laptop or iPad!
","
It is not really rose gold. It’s pink but it is still nice. I heard that the glass surface scratches pretty easily. I just left that protective film on and my phone charges just fine. Just make sure to place your phone in the proper position or it won’t charge. The green to blue light indicator is very helpful to know if it’s charging and it charges fairly fast.
","
I love the look of it and it works well. I keep it on my desk as a place to set my phone and keep it charged throughout the work day, and it’s perfect for that purpose. If you’re looking for a lightning fast charger though, this isn’t it.
","
This is my first wireless charger and I'm seriously impressed for the price. It's super slim and offers and very nice, sleek design to it which matches my room perfectly. I have it connected to an outlet and it charges just as well as my Apple charger. I love it so much and it seriously set the bar high for my preference in wireless chargers. Bravo!
","
Super slim design is great love the fact it uses type c for the power and love the flush simplistic design nothing to crazy the led lights great not to bright yet not to bare either. Very easy to set up from the box and love the feel of the product dose not feel cheap or plastic like other companies feels like a product of high quality tech at a great price point. Was honestly worth every penny
","
I really like this charger. It's solid and stable. My only slight complaint is that the LED lights are quite bright. Although I'm pleased that their is an indication of it's charging status, it could be a little dimmer.
","
I was hoping this didn't have any lights. When phone charging (laying on charger) can't see lights but otherwise can see them. The description wasn't clear. It's still fine though.
","
The product seems fine but due to my not knowing my phones limitations it didn't fulfill my needs.It's not the  vendors problem, it's mine
","
Works, attaches magnetically, but not terribly strong.
","
It works as described. It's not the fastest charger even with my wall charger base. It works though and charges through my phone case. I like the look and it's easy to travel with.
","
Cable charging is a lot faster however when your phone gets older and cannot charge through cable very well this is a decent alternative.
","
This charging disc quickly became one of my favorite purchases. No more wiggling lightning connectors until they break because the iPhone port gets too loose to hold them firmly. Now I just set my phone down on top of the charging disc and its good to go in a very short period of time. I just wish my older Apple devices supported proximity charging but that’s Apple’s fault. This is highly recommended.
","
This works on some of my phones and not others. It does look very nice though
","
I've only used it a few days so if it I change my mind I'll update. But it comes as advertised. Showed up in nice packaging with a 1 year warranty that was easy to register. Bought Rose Gold color to match my other devices and it looks great. Sleek, light, portable. Setup is just plugging in cord. Great buy on sale.
","
Overall great looking wireless charger and easy to use. I favored this one compared to other wireless chargers because of its thin and minimal design. Great use to have on the bedside table for easy charging instead of having to mess with cords at night.Pros:-Really thin and minimal design-Easy to see light indicator for use-comes in many colors-great traction padding on the bottom to keep it from sliding offCons:-Does not come with wall outlet adaptor-Connector cord could be longer
","
This is a great product. It works very well. My only complaint is that it has lights that are constantly lit. I cannot use it at night due to these lights. If they changed this it would be a 5 star review.
","
This is my first wireless charger and it has not disappointed yet! Works great for my Google pixel 4xl, I do have to take my case off which isn't too big of a deal since my case is thicker to protect my phone. Works great with the tozo wireless earbuds for charging as well. Doesn't work for my kiddos galaxy tablet but it just could be the tablet! Super great product for very affordable price! I was pretty amazed by the quality for the price! Great buy and very convenient!
","
My name is Jennifer and I purchased this on a family member’s account.I think this is honestly a great buy. I use it to charge my iPhone 11 and my Tozo ear buds. It charges fairly quick and is easy to use. It’s a cute little wireless charger with not much to it and I like that. I definitely recommend this product. I bought the rose gold.
","
I couldn’t get my wireless charger to work at first and became very frustrated. After emailing the company I got a swift reply back with trouble shooting information. Once I trouble shouted and my device still wasn’t working the company immediately gave me the option of getting a new device. My experience with them is great and they have a great customer support team.
","
works pretty well expect the cable doesnt always securely fit, but it uses a standard cable so I can use another cable easily
","
the piano black and LED's fit well and look nice on a desk or countertop. the surface is 'sticky' enough to keep an iphone with no case from sliding off.NOTE- if you don't have enough input current it blinks cyan-to-blue, but it's undocumented. this can happen if you have a dual USB charger and plug in the other cable to charge another device. For a while I kept moving the phone, thinking that was the issue...
","
It’s very finicky. You have to line up your phone just right, but the blue light lets you know when you’ve got it right. I often find that my phone hasn’t fully charged overnight because I didn’t place it just right
","
Wouldn’t travel with it. But for home use? Works like a dream and will fit into any decor. Just buy it. At the price they sell for… one for every room! One slight criticism, cord is a little short.
","
As a return customer for tozo products, I am again satisfied with this wireless charger. The product is packed with care and has a very nice feel and great quality to the touch. For charging, it works very fast and efficiently. The magnets stick on the back of the phone and makes it very nice and easy to use my phone while it is charging. I would personally recommend this charger to a friend.
","
I typically use apple products only, but this works fine as well.
","
Nicely made, and the LED indicators are an attractive and functional touch. However, these units are NOT compatible with Samsung for fast wireless charging. Samsung has recently started restricting fast wireless charging to units that have been certified by Samsung. This is enforced in their software, which turns off fast wireless charging mode when it senses a charging plate that doesn't meet their standard. This affects almost all Samsung phones and tablets, and leads to charging times dramatically longer than you'd hope.
","
Works well.  Super easy.
","
I was surprised when I see the wireless charger because it is the thinnest I have seen. It comes with the long enough USb cable. I plugged in my phone wall charger and peel the plastic off and put my phone and it started charging. Nothing to install and fast enough. It has non- slippy  pads on the back.  It is one of the best wireless charger, Easy to carry and I recommend this product.
","
I use this product for wireless charging my phone and my airpods pro. This is an amazing product that I would recommend for anyone who doesn't want to deal with the hassels of cords being in the way. Just sit your phone down and it will do the rest. I was also very impressed with the quality of this product which seems to be made with a really high grade metal. I would definitely buy another one of these.
","
Charges devises very fast
","
Works great so far. I love it. Only bad thing is I had to take my case off while using it. Im going to update this review in 2 weeks to see if anythings different.
","
I like everything about this charger. I bought the Green one and it looks like a lovely small plate. But, I was amazed at how quickly it charged my tozo T6 earbuds. It was easy, just placing the case with buds inside, on the disc and it lit up in blue, charging. Just put it inside my handbag and off we go. Easy.
","
The packaging was very nice and easy to figure out! I love the look of this charger (it's very sleek and the indicator lights on the side are useful). Granted I've only had this wireless charger for a couple of days but it hasn't failed me yet! Charges pretty fast and is easy to transport and clean. Overall love it and would buy again
","
This charger is great! I love having one device that can charge my iPhone and wireless headphones without having to have multiple charging cables all over the place. The price is substantially less than other chargers, and you’re losing nothing in terms of quality with this one. I particularly like the thin portable sleek design. I cannot recommend this product enough.
","
The design is slender and sleek... I love it!  I did have a concern about my phone not charging when placed directly on the center of the charger, but TOZO's customer service took care of me with no questions asked.  You can't go wrong with this modern design at this price!
","
Finally found a wireless charger that will charge through my case.  Just make sure your phone is lined up between the green lines, they will light up blue when charging.
","
I must say this charger is awesome and a great purchase. Good quality at a very reasonable price. I do recommend this product!!
","
I got the pink one, it's a little more difficult to see if your phone is charging due to the little light on the side, but other than that. I like it
","
The wireless charging pad is well made (has a nice weight to it) and the led indicator is a nice touch to let me know my phone is fully charged or still charging.Wireless charger doesn't take up a lot of room and very portable.
","
Picked up my charge right away and gave me a fast charge. Love the sleek white and gold glossy look. Will update if anything changes, but Tozo has always had quality products.UPDATE 11/9: This thing seems to be hit or miss. It either charges or it doesn't. I put my phone on it last night when I went to bed almost fully charged (I still like to go into the day with a full battery). When I woke up, it was at 88%. The charger and the phone did indicate that it was charging when I put it on, so I assumed that it was. I guess it stopped shortly thereafter? I haven't had any issues with any other wireless chargers, including the one it was replacing. This is a shame because I've used Tozo products before and they're usually pretty good.Another update: I popped my phone on and  actually watched it for a little. I also noticed that it lost quick charge after only a couple of minutes and went to regular charge.
","
I am very happy with this product. It is simple and easy to use and does exactly as advertised. The slim, compact design makes travelling  breeze and the fast-charging capability is much appreciated!My phone's charging port decided to crap out ob me about a week ago and I was extremely reluctant to spend $60 on fixing the port when I am planning on trading this phone in next month anyway. Finding this product was a major blessing for sure!
","
I’ve mounted this charger to a recessed hole in the bottom of a custom made desk.  The desk is 3/4 plywood and the recessed hole leaves 1/4 inch of wood for the charging signal to travel through.  I love how thin this charger is, which allows this to work!  All I have to do is place my phone or AirPods on the desk where the charger is hidden below and it charges!
","
Just received this yesterday so far it works good. Only complaint is the charger and my phone starts to get hot after only 10 minutes of being on the charger.. somewhat concerning. I didn't research enough I thought that you could charge the charger then use it wirelessly to charge the phone but the charger has to be plugged in to work
","
It is a slow charge but can leave old phone overnight and all is well
","
I really like this wireless charger and am impressed with how slim, light and efficient it is.  We will be ordering several more to give as gifts this holiday season. It Charges very quickly with the USB-C cable.  The USB to USB-C adapter is awesome.  I am surprised at how many family and friends have never seen a wireless charger.  It’s magic! No more fumbling with plugs!  Great useful, quality product for a great price.
","
Gotta say I was skeptical at the quality of this charger but I purchased 2 of them to give them a try. Let's just say I bought 2 more the next day. I'm very impressed with the solid construction, charging rate (when connected to a proper adaptive fast charger) and the look of the device. Nice and small, it fits in my laptop bag with ease. Overall very impressive for the price.
","
Its a nice sleek version of a charger but doesn't seem to support a fast charging mode.
","
This charger works appropriately and without any issues.It was a magnet that allows you to place the phone or the device to be charged correctly.
","
Mark. My. Words. I’m always super skeptical on whether or not a product and it’s price are equivalent. The quality, sleekness, aesthetic, and performance of this device exceeded my expectations several times over. The price is a little low for how nice it is (keep it like that though, haha), and I could not be happier with this device. Wirelessly charges my AirPod Pros, XS Max, 11 Pro Max, and Galaxy S20 like a charm. Fantastic job, and thank you so much! (Device comes with a year warranty too)
","
Thin, looks good, will stop charging when phone is full. Green when on,  blue when charging
","
I didn't really think I needed a wireless charger, but have been doing a lot of traveling lately, and let me tell you, it sure has come in handy! I love the size and weight of it, and the ease of use. It is super efficient, and has been real life saver when my phone is about to die. I definitely recommend!
","
Such an excellent charger! I put my phone on it at night, and it’s fully charged in the morning. I don’t have to worry about issues with my charging port, and if I want to use my phone while it’s charging, I just pick up the charger and hold it onto the back of my phone while I use it (which isn’t often, but it works). It’s also so sleek and beautiful! I got the rose gold version, and I couldn’t be happier.
","
It may be unfair to rate it a 3 on charging power, as this is my first wireless charger. It does take a while to charge, but my iPhone XR doesn't charge quickly anyways as I usually run it down to 1-3% before charging. It works well, has a great look. I like the lights  which change color based on it charging or not and like how well it manages shutting off (changing colors back as well) when my phone is fully charged.
","
My first charger stopped working after a couple of months but was able to get a replacement.  It took a bit of back and forth but was pretty easy to get it replaced.  If there are no issues with the new one I will update to 5 stars.
","
Aesthetically pleasing and very easy to use. just sit down whatever you want to charge on the pad and it charges decently fast, however I found that it might just be easier to charge it with a wired cord. With all these rules to a wireless charger such as ""don't leave it charging overnight it'll ruin your phone!"", ""be careful of the heat it could start a fire!"" it's simply just annoying.
","
I like that it is thin and charged fast. So far so good no problems. I keep it at work to charge my ear pods when needed. Love the fact that they charge wireless
","
Easy to use. Works well with both my Galaxy and husband's iPhone. Does not seem to have the problem of some other charging pads where the phone has to be *just so* perfectly positioned to start charging. Easy to understand the indicator light. USB-C connector (purchased July 2021). Also reasonable price and arrived quickly.
","
This wireless charger looks nice and sleek and charges my iPhone X fast. You need to connect it to 2A+ adapter to get fast charging speeds. I also figured out how to use it while I have the magnet of phone holder on the the phone. I simply moved the magnet up in the empty space next to the camera and that frees up the middle space and here the wireless charging coil is located underneath. I definitely recommend this product!
","
Out of all wireless chargers I’ve used, this one is the hardest to align in order to charge.
","

","
It charges my iPhone but won’t charge my husbands Android or my wireless earphones so idk why it says it will charge any phone not true.
","
I like the aesthetic of the charger, very minimalistic and elegant, and it charges my phone well.The drawbacks for me are:1) Required sweet spot: I have an iPhone 8 plus and because of the size of the phone to charger you need to make sure the LED changes color to ensure your phone is charging.2) LED lightsAt first, I liked the idea of the lights, but it quickly became a nuisance as it kept me up at night. So I would have to constantly unplug and replug the charger.All in all, It's still a good charger, but personally in the future, I'd look for something else.
","
Used with: iPhone 11Cons:  - slow charge  - phone has to be on at just the right spotPros:  - Looks nice  - small and slimSummary:  - I appreciate the look and how slim it is, but it's just so much slower compared to using a cable that I almost returned it. However, for the price it's a pretty convenient option  to have.
","
I liked it, it didn’t charge AirPods but for phone charging it was fine. My phone did get a little hot but nothing too bad.
","
This is a great product!  I wanted a wireless charger to place by my bed that did not emit a lot of light!  This charger has a small LED that Indicates charging and is not too bright!  This unit is very thin and and looks great.
","
Great looking product.Seems to be well made.Charges my new iPhone 12 Pro well.No complaints so far.Holding back one star until I have it a few months to see how well it wears over time.So 4 out of 5 for now.
","
The charger is great. Slim, easily portable, and charges well. The only problem is the LED indicator lights don't turn on to show that my phone is charging or fully charged like advertised or mentioned in the instruction manual. Would love for that function to work.
","
I have had this now for the past three weeks and the USB cord on it is very touchy.  It doesn't want to stay plugged in and the problem I don't like is it is a cord that is specific to unit.  You can't use your own cord.  I'm not sure at this point if I would recommend it because of the hassle of making sure its plugged in and staying plugged in to the unit.
","
Easy to use cordless charger. Only complaint is that the light is always on, even when it’s not charging. I have it on my bed side table and need to cover it at night when I m not using it.
","
I have had this wireless charger a little over 1 month now, and I can honestly say I have been very pleased with it's ease of function and look.  I have used this with 4 different devices, 2 iPhone 11 Pro and 2 iPhone 8 Plus.  The charger works well even with the cases on the phones (provided you are using a phone case that allows wireless charging).  The charger is attractive and looks sleek even when not in use, so we don't mind leaving it in a visible area.  So far I am quite pleased, and I am very happy with the friendly and responsive customer service.
","
The Product works as described. I ordered the gray pad and it uses usb type c to work. I have an Anker ac adapter I use with it. I use an iphone 11 and it works well. My wife has an iphone 8 and it also works.I mainly liked how thin this on was compared to others.Update: I ordered a second one for my wife. She got the rose gold one and likes it.
","
The charger is perfect for my GMC truck. It works great and is far cheaper than the factory charger.
","
Looks very stylish, does not take up a lot of space but its not the fastest charger i've used...after using this now for almost 2 weeks...no problems to report.
","
I’ll be using this bad for different purposes. The efficiency rate is rated at 76% so I’ll have to wait and see how it’ll charge my different devices. I’ll update my review once on have more information
","
Full disclosure, I have two others that work fine but this one just stopped in its tracks. Figured it was worth mentioning. 1 out of 3 failure rate isn't great. Also, they sent me a message offering me a free something or other in broken English. Free is nice but I'd rather get a solid product that I initially purchased. Focus on quality control then you won't have to worry about customer service.EDIT: they sent me a new one and it works as advertised. I now own three of these devices and all are working.
","
I have several wireless charging pads, but none with the magnetic feature. It was always a hit or miss if you didn’t place the phone directly on the sweet spot. This charger makes it super easy as it magnetically attaches to the newer iPhones. Charging power and time is good, and it is very easy to use. Just place the phone down and that’s it.
","
After 5 months it got so hot that the burned the USB cable. I tested it with another cable and it burned and destroyed both of them. Avoid this fire hazard.
","
I like that this charger shows a green light when it is receiving electricity and turns blue when charging. It was great for cell phones in a case; but could not be used for iPads in a case. It’s so much easier than using a cord.
","
Great product so far. Packaging is clean, sleek, and minimal. Charger itself feels nice, with 2 long, arc-shaped, rubber stoppers on the bottom and has a rubbery charging surface to protect from any scratching. I purchased the royal blue but I would say the color is more of a gunmetal blue, which was not a problem for me. It has a small green light to let you know it's receiving power and it isn't too bright. Finally, the charger is light and easy to pack if you're on the go. Overall, excellent purchase.
","
This is an awesome charger place my phone or ear buds until it’s charged and forget it no looking for charging cords. It’s lo profile is an added bonus. I received this a day before I was supposed to.
","
Easy to charger the power but not fast . And the power easy use it .
","
Charger was but a super charger as described but service was very kind to immediately send a replacement and actually allow me to keep the first charger. I  am waiting on the replacement charger now. Very easy to communicate with service and the response time was great.
","
Good product!
","
I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the Tozo wireless charger. The packaging it arrived in is small and is padded to protect the product from damage in transit. Set up of the charger was simple and easy. In terms of charging capabilities because of the USB-C it charges quite fast out of the box. My S10+ direct connected to my USB-C or on the wireless charger take the same time. It charges easily through a thinner case such as the Spigen case I have on my phone. If you decide to travel with this product I would highly suggest a protective case as the product is mainly glass and metal.
","
I bought this months ago and it still works great.  Charges quickly without over heating the phone and the light indicators to show it’s charging she when it’s done is a niiice feature... I use it for my IPhone andTotally Reccomend it
","
This is actually a great product.  It arrived very quickly, just like always for Amazon.  It is very thin, but the main reason I wanted it was to charge my iPhone 8 plus with the popsocket I just purchased.  One reviewer said it worked with theirs but it doesn't with mine.  I do not plan to send it back because it works well without the popsocket and their information didn't claim that it did.UPDATE: I changed it to a full 5 stars.  I decided the popsocket wasn't as useful as my wife thinks hers it.  Took it off and now the TOZO is my favorite chager.
","
Really stylish - low profile - and performs well. The changing light color when charging is a great touch! Everyone compliments it. Mine just sits discreetly on my desk, but I can think of a few ways you could modify furniture, computer cases, etc. to incorporate one. *And it has not burned the house down yet!
","
I love the ease of use. I pulled it out of the box, plugged it in, set my phone on it. So it’s super easy to use. Slim, compact design that’s good for traveling. Good charging power too. I’d say it’s right up there with a wall plug in charger. It’s a great buy and have convinced others of buying it as well.
","
I use it for overnight charging and it works fine. The only problem is for at night the light is bright
","
Easy to use there was no set up i plugged it in and set my phone on it and it automatically started charging. I have a Samsung galaxy s10+ with an Otter box  My wife's phone did the same thing and her case is thicker than mine she has a galaxy note. Well designed and works great bought it so I wouldn't have to cable charge my phone any more.
","
This charger is a modern and sleek design, great for the look I was going for. It’s easy to use, it can charge my iPhone and airpods but cannot charge my Apple Watch which is fine. I love the pink and the white, it’s easy to know when my phone is done charging. The thinness is perfect for a subtle look, I wonder if it will scratch if I were to take it places. And I am still debating if it’s easier to bring around than the cord charger.
","
Much nicer than the other wireless chargers I own, high quality materials and looks really nice.  The LED on the surface clearly shows when the device is charging and when it has completed.
","
This charger is currently my favorite — I have a google pixel, and have several of the google pixel wireless chargers as well, but prefer this one for next to my bed. The light from it makes it easier to place my phone correctly in the dark, but is not so bright that it keeps me up, and the phone covers the light completely when in place.
","
This wireless charger works well for the iPhone, but the charge AirPods wirelessly you have to make sure you set them down at the correct angle. It's not a big deal as long as you check to make sure they're charging before you walk away, which is easy to do since the LED on the charger changes color!
","
It charges well but I don’t like how you have to leave it down flat the whole time. Also you have to pay attention that phone does not move then charging will not continue.
","
Great
","
Very visually appealing with Glossy top surface.  Charger pad is only as thick as the plug.  I did have a problem with original unit, but fantastic customer support got me a replacement within the week and no problems since.
","
This is so sleek and works great. I am the worst at plugging my phone in before bed and it’s always dead.This has made it so much easier to just drop the phone on the pad and wake up with it charged.My fiancé made fun of me when I first ordered it for being lazy and now he has one also. It’s such a game changer if you’re not great about plugging your phone in.
","
I think these look very modern and sleek. I bought a white and black one and it looks great amongst my decor and modern looking apartment. It’s not super fast charging, so if you need a quick charge then you should just plug your phone into a regular adapter, but I never run my phone that low. I make it a habit to lay my phone on one of these vs just setting down on a counter top. Charges my iPhone 11 in a case and AirPods.
","
Third charger of bought as they are convenient in different locations. They work well and I like this rose gold one I just purchased. At one point I was concerned it wasn’t working but after restarting my phone it charged just fine.
","
I like it. Even though I didn’t keep the product the company was great on trying to make it up to me. The customer service was great and they really took the time to make it right with me in the end and I appreciate it. I like them and may use them again in the future. I do recommend them. My friend is using them and like their product.
","
This charger with the proper power supply charges Samsung Note 9 at Fast charge even with a case on! Super cost effective, with great color options! Even works with Iphone's with a case installed and a knob on the back!! WoW!
","
I am very satisfied with Tozo wireless charger I have been looking for a really good charger  for a long time this one tops them all, I am very thankful that I got a chance to try your product and get great results, it is so convenient for me to just place my phone down knowing that by the time I return to my phone it will be fully charged.  is the most easiest Task that I need to do for the day, now I feel that my day will be good because I have a fully charge cell phone. Now I would live for my daughter to try this amazing product.
","
I'll be honest, I pretty much just picked this charger because it looks nice, and it definitely does! It definitely doesn't have as much quick charging power as other wireless charges we have in our house, but it gets the job done fine. Two things I don't love: 1.) You definitely have to get your phone lined up just right. More than once I've woken up to an uncharged phone. 2.) I wish the cord was longer. I have an outlet pretty close to my bed, but the standard cord just barely stretched far enough to reach my nightstand.
","
have two of these for my kindle fire and my kindle Paperwhite signature, they do a great job no complaints even through the covers I have on my kindles one of which was stated by reviews to block wireless charging!
","
not the fastest charge but comes in handy in a pinch
","
This is the first wireless charger I have got and when compared with others I have seen from co-workers, the design is great and very slick. It is easy to use and you can either plug it directly to a USB port or to a ""Quick Charge"" adapter (sold separately) and you are ready to start charging your device. I have an iPhone X with a case and have no issues charging the phone through the case. With the quick charger adapter, it manages to rapidly charge the phone and other wireless charging enabled devices (I have also a pair of earbuds that are being changed too). Kudos to TOZO for a great product.
","
The only drawback of this charger is that because the surface is so sleek the charger indicator light comes across as quite bright in a dark room.  Otherwise it is nice looking and works well.
","
Solid fast charging wireless dock.  Never used one before because of slow charge times. This one os great and works well. Like with all of these if your case is really thick may not work. I use this with the new charge block that gives the higher voltage and no problems so far. Big thumbs up
","
Great charger, easy to use. Plug and go
","
this product is beautiful and made out of glass. very sleek design. i had to use the charger for my ipad which gives more charging power because the regular box was not doing it. idk if it is my outlet or the item but would definitely buy again!
","
I am really impressed with this compact wireless charger. Works beautifully with my iPhone 11 and charges very quickly. I love the fact that it comes with the adapter for USB C and USB. The other nice thing about the design is that it's very compact. I can carry it in my pocket.  The build quality seems very good and i am very happy with the purchase
","
It’s very thin and portable. Super easy to use. Plug it in and set your phone in it. The only problem I noticed is that if the phone isn’t perfectly placed on it then it won’t charge.  It it blinks to let you know this so that’s pretty cool.
","
Fast charge not compatible for Z flip 3 5G.
","
The Tozo W1 wireless charger is probably one of the best looking wireless chargers on the market.  Super slim, black glass surface and led lights on the surface (green has power turns to blue when charging) that add to the beauty and functionality. I charge my iPhone XS Max on this charger without removing my case.  Time will tell on the longevity of the product, but I have high expectations.  Definitely would buy again.
","
This is currently embedded in my center console because of how thin it is and how fast it charges. Older trucks didn’t have fun stuff like this but it doesn’t have to be that way! Love this thing so much I got another for charging my phone inside. 10/10 would recommend to someone looking for a fast and reliable charger.

This is the first wireless charger I've ever purchased, and so far I'm really satisfied. It's small and doesn't take up much space, but feels sturdy. It worked flawlessly out of the box. No complaints really, it does exactly what it's supposed to and it looks great. It comes with a USB cable but does not come with a wall adapter, so keep that in mind. I just plugged it into a USB hub and it worked flawlessly.
","
have no issues with the product other than the fact i do not carry a brief case , of back pack/pocket book .for someone who travels light it is more convenient to put a cord in my pocket. other than that looks good , works well
","
We have two of these chargers in our home now. We love them. They are fast, and they easy to move around. I will be buying more in the future.
","
I had high hopes for this product , but connectivity was spotty and required way to much attention.  It is going back
","
Recently ordered this W6 mini wireless charger for my iPhone. Nice & compact, chargers with my popsocket on my iPhone case. The cord to the charger doesn’t separate but does come with a USB adapter to plug into standard USB ports.Only con is wish it had rubber pad on the underside to keep it from sliding.The magnet only works with the current iPhone 12 models.
","
This is one of the best wireless charger, I found on Amazon. I've bought several others and I would have to move the phone around for it to detect the charger. With this one no matter how I place the phone on it, it detects it right away. I have an iphone 11 with an otterbox as a case and no problem at all.
","
Bad experience. Don't buy this device just by look.My personnel experience, The device stopped working just after a month. per TOZO the  warranty is just valid for a 30 days.
","
I bought this charger after my Anker wireless charger died after about 6 months. I bought this one when it was on sale, and I must say I couldn't be happier. The charger looks absolutely gorgeous on a table. It has a large surface area and is extremely thin. So, it kind of ""melds"" into the table itself. In my experience, it charges the phone quickly (I have iPhone 11 Pro). I also have those totally-wireless earbuds. So, I can just put the case of those buds on this charger and it works perfectly. No more fiddling with lightening cable or micro-us cables etc. We'll see how long it survives though
","
These are pretty easy to find for relatively cheap, but I got to say, after going through several cheap WalMart buys, this one was the last one I tried, and I am very happy. It has a nice blue color while charging that isn’t too bright, and it doesn’t take long at all to charge. About the same as my cord charger does.
","
This is working like it should, but the flashing charging lights drive me crazy while I'm trying to go to sleep.
","
This looks BEAUTIFUL on my white desk, it's a slim profile and charges my phone faster than I thought it would. The best part is that it charges it even with a case. I use my phone so often that it really helps to get a constant charge. The charger is beautiful, the shine is amazing, the profile is great. It doesn't come with a charging block, but I didn't think it would. It does, however, come with a wire.
","
I like the product m, easy to use and power other things than the iPhone but the charging takes a while
","
It is sleek and cute but.....doesn’t charge fast and for some reason from time to time it chooses not to charge my phone although it is placed correctly. I’ve tried to leave my phone charging over night and wake up to find out my phone is still at 10%...
","
I sadly have been unable to use this item due to my cell phone not being compatible. But it was easy to set up and a perfect size for me.
","
Thought I ordered chrome colored one.  Package said gold, but it's white! If it works good, it doesn't matter. To get warranty, had to do review before really trying it! I do like the way it looks.
","
Great little product! The design is really slick. It looks great on my desk. I love that the colored detailing changes depending on what it's doing - green means it's waiting, blue means it's charging, etc. I'm using my Samsung Note 8 with it.I've used it a few times and it seems to charge pretty well for a wireless thing. It probably charges at 1/3 the rate of my plug-in Samsung Fast Charger. It's good for letting your phone rest overnight, but not very fast if you need a quick power-up.
","
Tiene un diseño muy bonito y elegante pero las luces me molestan durante la noche. Es lento para completar la carga. Es mi primer cargador de este tipo, no se si es normal, pero es muy lento. De todos modos Tozo es una marca q me gusta mucho, compre estos porque tengo  bluetooth de ellos y me encantan
","
The wireless charger seems to be one of the best looking chargers out there.  It's really thin and the glass/mirror finish looks great.  Charging is a lot faster than the standard iPhone charger.  I like the ease of use because I don't need to  unplug and plug the charger back in when I charge my phone.  I can just drop my phone on top of it and forget about it.  It also comes with a 1 year warranty which is great.  One downside could be you have to buy the a/c adapter separately.  I'm just nit-picking, but for the price you can't go wrong.  Nice item.
","
Never struggle with broken cords or loss of charge again.

 The W3 wireless charger works great - just as you’d expect and want. See attached video for LED status light functionality.The included USB Type-C cable is handy for my other type-c devices when I’m traveling- only one cable required.This slim wireless charger packs easily, works flawlessly, and isn’t too bright on my bed stand at night.Definitely a solid value for the price.
","
Great wireless charger, purchased to charge my wireless ear buds.
","
This charger is pretty nice.  It's thin and looks very modern.  I really like it because there aren't any bright light illuminating my bedroom.  I like the room dark when I sleep.  It has lights on it, but if you want it dark, you can cover them with your phone.  Not sure if it charges fast because I put my phone on it when I go to sleep.  100% when I wake up, but not sure how long it takes.  I also like that it uses a USB-C cable, the same as my Samsung Note 10.  Good job Tozo!
","
It was really easy to setup and worked right away my only issue is it only comes with a USB cable. I always wanted a cheap wireless charger. It lights up when it has power.
","
It looks good and is fairly simple to use.  Sometimes I have to move my phone around to get the connection.  It is pretty slow charging but if you read the fine print there is an adapter you can buy to make it faster.
","
Very happy to find this! I've tried a few other wireless chargers but they didn't really work with my iPhone13 Pro. This one works perfectly to charge my phone with thin plastic case on, as well as my wireless earbuds.
","
This is my first time using a wireless charger and I'm very impressed with it so far. It's sleek and looks very nice on my night stand. Plus it's easy to charge my phone in the dark, I just have to set my phone down and then the lights on the wireless charger turn blue to signal that my phone is charging. I don't have to struggle trying to plug my usb cord into my phone in the dark. This wireless charger is also able to charge my phone at a decent speed, but it isn't as fast as using a regular charger. Overall, this is a great wireless charger for a great price.
","
The product is so simplistic it is great. Life is complicated enough that you want anything that makes you life simpler. This is my first phone that had the option of wireless charging and having had past issues with wired charging cords to phones I look forward to this unit. Have only had it a short time but if it continues being this good it will be worth every penny.
","
I love this wireless charger! It is beautifully designed and works really well. When you place your device on the charging pad, the indicator lights on the wireless charger change from green to blue. I have had this charger for about two weeks so far and have had no issues with it. I highly recommend this charger!
","
Works and looks great.  I just wish the LEDs would turn off.  I don't want a night light.
","
Customer service was great!I got it to try on my son's tablet since he has a tendency to warp cords! It didn't work. Nor did it work with any of my families phones (LG) except mine (samsung). Doesn't even charge that well/fast.
","
It’s a great size. A bit of a slower charge, but very easy to use.
","
Works well with fast charging, durrable, easy to set up and store for travel, and the light to let you know the device is charging is very helpful. One issue is that it is a 'larger' charging pad and you would think the charging target area would be a bit larger as well. Unfortunately, that is not the case and sometimes it takes a little while to find the right spot to get the charge to work. Ok over all, very satisfied.
","
Does what it supposed to do. No complaints so far. Just wish it pad could be lifted at an angle so it could double as a stand. Will update if anything else changes
","

 Very compact and light. Very convenient and perfect for travel given the size.Works great and achieves ""fast wireless charging"" status on my Note 20+ using my adaptive fast charge wall plug. (Please note it does not come with wall plug, but does come with cable and plug adapter). Also charges my Samsung earbuds via wireless charge.
","
Initially, I was a little hesitant about purchasing a charger that would be readily visible in my office. When the TOZO W1 charger arrived and was unboxed, I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful it is. It's design is sleek, elegant, and it's easy to use. I simply put my phone (iPhone XS) on the base and it charges instantly.The charge is steady and I will definitely reorder this item.
","
The slim charger doesn't boost my iPhone.  I disconnected it and used a cable instead.  It's pretty though
","

 Works perfectly and it's super thin easily fit in my back pocket with no discomfort. Looks great perfect for work or at home. Charged through my case on my personal phone and takes usb-c which is great for power transfer and being universally available. Very lightweight too! Rubber feet so it doesn't move on a shaky table/desk. Just a good product that does exactly what it should!
","
Great charger especially for the price. Charging works through my case. Green light shows it’s plugged in and when phone is on, light changes to blue to confirm charger is working. Love having this wireless charger where I can just set my phone down and not worry about plugging it in. Other plug charges have stopped working for some reason but this is great.
","
This seems to be a much better charger than the W1. Not that the W1 is a bad charger (because I have that one too), but the W3 is a bit faster and much thinner. It's easy and convenient to use and charges my TOZO wireless earbuds quickly. I also use it for my Samsung S9. It doesn't keep a light on while charging like the green light on the W1. I would highly recommend this charger.
","
Another Great Tozo Product!I bought this for my wife because she was having problems charging her phone with another wireless charger. She has no problems with the Tozo!  It chargers her phone every time & it's fast!
","
I use the Tozo charger through my Nekmit Home Charger. The Tozo when on has green band indicators,when you place something to charge on it, it turns indigo blue. Charges very fast, Works great ;)Thank you,RMS
","
I did keep the package it came in to protect it when traveling for my bag or suitcase so not to damage it.. I love it cause I don’t have to worry about cords that don’t last or damage to the port on phone. I also can charge my AirPods on it..
","
Otherwise easy to use
","
Plug and play device setup. Provides simplicity of wireless charging. Perfect for my TOZO earbuds. Got white for wife and black for myself. She loves being able to just place the earbuds case on it and then pick it up fully charged. Charges my high-capacity battery in the charging case pretty fast. Very happy with this purchase.
","
This is the 2nd one I’m buying not because the first one is no longer working. It still works great after a year. I just want to have one where I work and one by my bed. I am very happy with this product. Excellent charger and charges up my iPhone 11 much quicker than my friend’s wireless charger.
","
Not the fastest charging and you need to make sure your phone is on the sweet spot but it’s a good for your desk . Overall it could be better .
","
Just fair enough for the value of money, not too fast but ok
","
This is a great travel charger for me when I’m away for business. Easy to pack and looks nice and stylish when I use it at home. I like how thin it is.
","
I have been searching for a wireless charger since I got my new phone. came across the grey one and it appealed to me. It was slim and has USB-C as a port so its conforms to newer standards. There's only one thing I don't like about it. I use it on top of my night stand right now and the indicator light to tell you its on is a bit bright. other than that its a well designed product and would recommend it to anyone in search of a good wireless charger. I plan on recessing this one into the nightstand so its flush with the table see how that works out.
","
This is a slick looking charger.  I have a leather cover on a Samsung S7 and it charges just fine with the cover on.  It does seem to be a little weaker when used in the car.
","
Sucks can’t use in car slides right off but other then that it’s great
","
The only reason that I can’t give this a five star rating is the fact that you can’t really use while you are charging, other than that it actually does what it claims to do.
","
My wife loves this charger. going to buy her a Samsung Charger like I have but the price on this one was so good that we had to try it. 1/4 the price of Samsung Charger and works just as good or better. Very happen with this product. Works with my wifes Note 9 and my Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Highly recommend.
","
Beautiful little wireless charger...First time using the wireless features after having to upgrade my phone. So tested my Samsung S20 +.Love the look ...easy to stow but as always wish for faster charge...Just a cord...No Power Brick  =(Still would recommend for the nightstand.Just a ..TaiChiDummt
","
My phone has a rather thick Otter Box cover. So when I place it on the charger it appears to take longer than usual to charge. When I remove the cover, charge time is definitely reduced.
","
Really like this little charging puck. The photos are dark so you can see the LED’s. Green when waiting, fully charged and blue when charging. I using with my tozo ear buds and iPhone 11. It’s nice and thin with a shiny finish with silver accents on the side that don’t look cheap
","
It’s very thin so it fits in small places. When i got it it didn’t come with the adapter but i already had one luckily, it doesn’t heat up or anything and works great with my iphone 11. But it might be inconvenient to anyone who gets it because it has no adapter and you can’t use any apple adapters either. But is otherwise a great product
","
This is the 3rd one I've bought. I now have one at home and work and this one I bought for my husband. They really work great.
","
Great Charger! Lay your phone on it and forget it. No fussing with cords or plugs any more.I had a different brand that had problems charging any phone that was in a case. You had to position the phone just so on the charger or it would not work. Not so with this charger. Just lay your phone onto this charger any old way and it charges fine. I love it.
","
I just purchased this product and it works really well. It can charge wireless bluetooth devices. I am really impressed with the quality of it. If my phone (Samsung Galaxy A20) was compatible with this device, it would probably charge it! I read that it is compatible with higher versions of Android and Apple phones. Definitely worth the investment!
","
Charges slower, but is helpful for folks with broken charge ports on a budget.
","
Delivery was quick and the packaging was great. Setup was easy and everything seems to be in working order. For reference, I have an iPhone 8 Plus with a case on it and charging was immediate. The size and placement of my phone on the wireless charger covers all lights, so a nighttime glow is not an issue for me.
","
This charges my wireless earbuds perfectly.
","
I have had mine for a couple weeks or so.  Works well. I love being able to lay my phone there without plugging in a cable.  Most charging pads are not quite as fast as using the cable but close enough for me.  If my phone rings during charging time I can pick it up, answer, then after conversation complete simply lay it back down on the pad. So easy.  This is a product that I would buy again.
","
It had major problems with connecting. Even with taking my case off every time to charge (which is way more of a hassle than a cord), it had trouble charging. I wish it were stronger.
","
This charger does what they all do when they work like they should. I really like the flat style. Its easy to use, and its easy to take when i will be gone. My favorite thing about it however is how it looks and feels. Its thin,but feels substantial in my hand...and it looks really classy. This product exceeds expectations.
","
This product is fantastic! It works great and it is extremely simple. It stops charging at around 98% to save the battery which is great. There was a small mark on it when I got in the mail... and it can get a little warm sometimes. All in all, it is a great product and well worth the price. 4.5 stars!!!
","
Beautiful design, extremely thin, high quality device.  Lights are subtle and phone can be rotated to cover them completely for zero lights if required, no issues for us.  Extremely pleased with the charger, great product and really well priced.  Using with iPhone X in cases, without issue, also auto cut off works well and have noticed no temp issues, great simple & elegant device.
","
It's easy to use. I didn't have to fish around for just the right position. It's not the fastest charger, but definitely works well enough. I'm happy with it.
","
I've have several wireless chargers, and with them you have to put the phone on just right. Sometimes adjusting it. Sometimes, taking it off and putting it down again -- so much so that I wonder why I didn't just save time and plug it in. Not with this one. Put it anyone on the pad and instantly (not the lag I have with some others) it starts charging. The lag is important, because during that time you're wondering whether the phone is on right and is charging, so you're just standing there, waiting for the phone to indicate it's charging. This one's great.
","
Easy to use
","
This is pretty small, a bit smaller than a CD.  I returned it because I found it a bit difficult to get it to charge due to having to find the sweet spot where it would charge.  I didn't want to leave my phone on it all night only to find it dead in the morning because it was off-center by 1/2 inch.
","
Overall we are very happy with the product. We found it very stylish in design and the charging light is not too bright or over bearing. The aluminum case is slim and has a nice quality feel to it. Great for my traveling and work charging needs. I did not realize that it does not come with a power plug, just the cable and wireless charger. Also the charging speed depends on the power plug wattage so for those comments regarding the charging speed it will depend on their power source. We found that it charges quickly as advertised. Great product overall and I would definitely recommend it.
","
I've had a number of these before. These are by far the best I've ever owned. They even charge through otter boxes and pop sockets. I bought one, and liked it so much I now have 4 of them scattered through my house. It's perfect.
","
Not Only Convenient, But also Stylish. Let's You When Charging and When Charging Is Done. Love It
","
This is my first wireless charging device and it's great!!!! I did purchase a plug with the 3.0 charging thing (I found Amazon's top choice 2 ports for 10 bucks, they're great too). The cable isn't super long, but it's good enough! Got one for my boss and myself too hehe. Does fast charge my Samsung and my boss iPhone
","
Excellent! Nice looking and it works very well.
","
There is not much that I don't like.  It was very easy to setup, charges very well. I haven't gone out of town lately so I will have to wait on how it travels.. My only dislike is that it doesn't have an adapter.  I did end up buying two more for my son and husband.  They also like them alot.
","
This wireless charging pad looks very sleek and clean for its very affordable price. The design is flawless and I love how the LED lights change from green (powered on) to blue (charging) when I place my device on top. I have also bought the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds that work phenomenally as a pair of wireless earbuds. They fit this royal blue charging pad so well and I cannot wait to try more of their products! I highly recommend you grab one of these charging pads before they run out of stock or the prices go up. It's a great deal!
","
While charging speed for wireless chargers is generally slower than that of conventional charging cables, this model does seem to take longer to get my iPhone 12 to a full battery.
","
So disappointing. Time remaining to charge When I plug my Samsung fast charger with cord is 1.5 hours faster than with W1. It does not fast charge note 20 ultra. Instructions inside box also does not list note 20 ultra even thought the item Description states all models. Update Description please!!!
","
This is a really sleek and well designed product. It's incredibly thin and looks very sophisticated. Unfortunately, it has a specialty power cord that is only 38 inches long. I bought this as a gift for my parents but I know that the power outlet is not close enough to their side table to be of any use. I'll be keeping this for myself because of the design and price point but will only be able to use it on my desk or kitchen counter. I'll be buying a different product for my parents that uses a micro-USB charging cord. That way they can use their longer cord and easily replace the cord if it wears out.
","
The wireless charger was very pretty sleek design, it’s a clean white with lights that change colors depending on what it’s doing. The term wireless is not completely true it does need to be connected to an outlet which is my fault for not reading the description thoroughly. My only issues are t’s not compatible for all phones, it takes waaaaay too long to charge my phone & i have to remove my case for it to actually charge my phone. I think it was a good idea just poorly executed for this i’ll give 3 stars. I don’t think i’d purchase again or recommend to a friend.
","
The setup was so easy.  Just plug into the charger and a USB port and it's ready to use.  Charging time on my Galaxy S9 is very fast.  A have a fairly substantial case and it was invisible to the charger.  A great value.
","
I had to give this four stars because I ordered gold to match my room decor, but it was more like a rose gold when it arrived.  It isn’t really a big deal, but if you want to purchase this because the picture makes it seem like it’s truly gold, take this into consideration.  The charger functions just fine and Works as advertised.
","
Fast charging and easy to use. I can use my phone while it's charging.
","
While it charges very well and very fast, I did not realize it had such brilliant lights in the surface.  Had to move this to my office instead of using it next to my bed at night.
","
WOW!!!is all I can say. The packaging was great on both. Instructions were simple to follow and pairing was a breeze. The best parts were, the comfort in the earliest. It felt as if I had nothing there and that's never happened. Charging was indeed lightning fast and the case  was perfect size to fit in my smallest of purses . Most importantly the quality of sound from the ear piece was amazing. I'm normally tight with money but I would gladly pay well over $100.00. For these.
","
First impression: Love the look and feel of this charger! Very sleek. The top is a nice slip-free silicone surface. Very well made.Performance: have not had it long enough to tell and compare.
","
Charger works well and has a very low profile.  The only downside is that the green ""ready"" lights stay on continuously and are fairly bright.  At night if you don't have your phone on it you have to turn it over or it's like a green beacon.  Otherwise, nice device.
","
Thought I posted a review a week ago, but can't find it, so . . .My phone isn't capable of being charged wirelessly, but my several earbuds are, and I love the convenience of this charger. It works great, and I have found Tozo to be very responsive in the customer service department . . . in case service is needed. Highly recommended!
","
So, long story short they sent me the wrong color, but I don't care, this has turned out to be a great wireless charger for my Pixel 5!  It's no quick charger, but only 1 hour to get my phone from 1/2 to full was reasonable + I have a Spigen case on my phone as well.5 out of 5 would buy again.
","
I like not having to use a plug  anymore, but you can't just drop your phone on it and expect it to charge. You'll have to wiggle your phone around to find the sweet spot.
","
Love the rose gold color. It's thin and easily fits into my purse or pocket. I bought one in rose gold and one in space gray for my husband. I'm satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend! The charging power is decent and is comparable to most wireless chargers. I like these bc of their sleek design and portability.
","
I bought this for my daughter. She wanted something that wouldn’t take up too much space on her desk. She wanted this one even though the newer version is a bit smaller because she prefers the bigger lights. She hasn’t had it long but it was quick and easy to set up and works as it should.
","
Sometimes when I plug my phone in I get the message that moisture is detected. This drives me crazy. Well, this charger solved my problem.  Just lay the phone on it & poof, it charges. The lights do not keep me awake. I have no problem sleeping with this on my nightstand.
","
Just what I needed for my Nexus 7 tablet. Would highly recommend
","
This is really easy to use and it looks great. I just wish everyone would use USB C for all the things, I hate swapping between micro USB and C, and this is yet one more device that uses micro USB, but the device itself is really attractive and works great. I wish I had more of these instead of the expensive Google Pixel stands I bought a while back.
","
The thing I love most about this wireless charger is that it is powered via USB C, which makes it a lot faster. It has a beautiful sleek design, and is surprisingly really great quality. Super easy to use, all you have to do is plug it in to a usb slot, place your phone on top, and voilà - WORKS PERFECTLY! What more can you ask for, for this amazing price?!
","
Looks good and seems to work. Other wireless chargers need precise placement while this seems to have some give which is great. Removing 1 star because there is a blinking green light which sort of bothers me at night.
","
I never owned a charging pad, but my parents did and from time to time, it would work yet it was slow. I decided to order one for myself, and I stumbled upon this exact model and decided to give it a shot--the best decision I've ever made! It's fast charging, portable, and it immediately started charging instead of processing like my parents.. Great product!
","
This is a great table top charger.  I have purchased 2 of these units and they work flawlessly.  One night I guess I had too much static built up and when I touched the charger there was a static discharge and the lights on the charger went out.  I thought that it was done for, but unplugging the power cable from the unit and plugging it back in, did the trick and it has worked fine ever since.  I guess that would be a testament to the protective circuitry.
","
As long as I place the phone centered on the charger it has worked every time
","
I really like this charger. Sleek lines, recognizes my phone quickly even with a thick case. The indicators are intuitive and you know when it is charging. I have had a static charge zap this thing a few time when reaching for my phone and it holds up fine. One other brand I had a single shock would kill it.
","
My phone tends to charge more quickly using this wireless charging pad than when it is plugged into a charging cable. The indicator lights make it easy to know at a glance whether the phone is charging or fully charged.
","
I routered out a pocket in the bottoms side of my night stand top so I’m able to use this charger through about an 1/8” of particle board plus my phone case.
","
I would say this is a great little device to keep at your bedstand to enjoy. It's super slim and pleasing to the eyes. The light changes from a green to a blue to show when charging and the charging pad takes up very little room. I think for the price it's a great product the only thing I would like to see improved is how fast it charges your device, but I usually use mine for night so when I dose off I just set it down and if while I'm waiting for it to charge I do productive things while I wait so overall I enjoy having this wireless charger around.
","
I have to say, a lot of times when you order a cheap product off of Amazon, you get just that.  This is one of rare times, that I actually got what seems like a quality item for a low price.  Of course, time will tell its true quality, but initially, its a solid charger. It looks extremely nice, has indicator lights that tell you its charging. But best of all, it just looks good.  I don't know if it fast charges, I put my phone on it before bed, and its charged in the morning.  So, it does what  it claims.
","
This is the first charing pad I've owned and it's exactly what I was looking for. Its slim not bulky and not black 😆. Wish it came in purple instead of pink though. Only problem I've had with it is about a dozen times it has stopped charging my phone at night. When I woke up it has been at almost full or about 40%. No reason why it wouldn't charge it either. But overall great charger especially for the price. BUT I could of done without the pink. Maybe make more solid color options just not colored edges on black, white or silver chargers. In the matte option as well as glossy .  Update the charging issue has gotten worse. It doesn't charge my phone half of the time. Right now my phone is at 14% and it's been on charger for 7 hours! I contacted the seller. Will update if I get a response otherwise I'll be contacting Amazon. My charger isn't even 3 months old. Current rating with charging issue is 1 star. It may be pretty and slim but I need a reliable charger. I need my phone for work. I can't do my job without it .
","
Whoever came up with this is awesome !! I love it and it makes things so easy to charge my phone. I have it by my bed and it’s just the easiest, not a bad price ! I never knew I needed something so much
","
The Tozo W6 charger is very compact and great for travel. It it magnetic and can grip the iPhone 12 or other phones with a magnetic strip within the back case. It can connect to a USB-C port or with the extra connector to a USB-A or C port. It also chargers more quickly than other wireless chargers I’ve used. I highly recommend this charger.
","
Not for fast charging.

I haven't used it long enough to give many details. It looks like it's good quality, easy to use, just plug it in. The charge power is fine for not having a direct plug in to the phone. I have a thick rubber case on my phone and it doesn't interfere at all.

 If you're looking for a wireless charger, this is a good one. It will charge about anything, and it's high output, so it charges thinks quickly. Solidly built and a good quality finish, I'm impressed. Not much to say, but it's a great charger at a great price. If you don't use wireless charging, you need to start.. :)
","
I liked this product very much. It was easy to use and it charged my iPhone 11 even with a thick case.  It is a very good charger for it’s price. I recommend this a lot.  The only thing I would like is if it would have brought its own charger not only the cable but the charger itself.
","
Sleek, clean and modern look. Just throw your phone on. Works with the case on also. I use a magnet on my case for quick attachment to my car mount so the downside is that once the magnet is attached to the case it no longer worked. The case is easy enough to remove and replace to quickly place the phone on the charger while at home rather than looking for cords in the middle of the night to plug in.
","
First off, the functionality of the product is great. I use a thick case for my phone so I am able to charge it regardless of that. The same goes for my Airpods. I also think the charging station is pretty and makes a great addition to an office space. This was a great purchase for me!
","
I like the charging power and ease of charging.  Just wish the charging chord was longer
","
I purchased this product to provide wireless charging, since my phone became harder to charge using my cord.  This was a great solution. I was really impressed with quality of the charger for such a resonable price. The setup  was super easy, just a matter of plug and play. I would gladly recommend this charger to any one who's looking a quality wireless charger at a very reasonable price!!
","
Everything seems fine and it works fine but it doesn’t work with having a pop socket behind my phone so that’s kind of a bummer cuz I need my pop socket behind my iPhone.
","
Works great. But there are lights on either side that are quite bright and can bothersome if you’re charging at night in your room.
","
Works very well charges very fast easy to travel with
","
The 10 Amp rated disk charges my new 2021 Fire HD10 plus tablet perfectly, apparently at the fast rate.  Super thin, fixed to the center of a swing arm tablet holder, it makes it very easy to move the tablet in and out without worrying about damaging the USB port or cables.
","
I just received the charger today and I'm already in love! Even though it doesn't come with the AC Adapter, that doesn't bother me or detract from the value of this charger(I have a billion ac adapters sitting around and I already have a 5V that came with my mobile device). It's a very simple design that doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, and its so tiny that it fits just about anywhere. No more wear-and-tear on my device ports! This is definitely the way to go.
","
I received my charger and plugged it in it turned on just fine and I was thrilled at how quickly it charged my earbuds and my phone! But by the third or fourth day the charger went completely blank and I can't get it to come back on since then.UPDATE: the company sent me a replacement and I've had no problem with it! Thank you for great customer service I really appreciate the extra steps you took!
","
Plug and play ready. Comes with the wireless charging base and a micro usb cable to fit. Had no issues using my own cube. The cord it came with works great, I also had no issue using my own longer, 10' charging cable to extend the range from a plug. Very dependable. I bought this as an alternative to using a charging cable, it has met and exceeded my hopes and expectations.
","
I love the concept, but it only works when you put your phone on the charging pad just right. It doesn't charge as quickly as plugging my phone in, but it will charge my phone completely overnight.
","
Bought this for my son after two previous wireless chargers died on him. This one was cheaper than the other two I had previously bought but so far its far better quality. Slim, sleek design and my son loved that he got navy blue to match his laptop. I will definitely be considering this brand for future purchases.
","
Definitely get the QC charger like they say! It looks really nice and is amazing quality. I use it with my iphone SE 2020 and it works perfectly with the case on. Color changes to let you know it is charging and it is not overly bright that you would notice the light while sleeping. I have a waterproof case on my phone, so it makes it much easier to charge without undoing the waterproof flap for the charging port. I am getting one for my boyfriend as well!

 Se ve un producto muy útil, aún no lo e podido usar porque llego dañado, pero me enviaran otro. Buen servicio y respuesta inmediata al soporte técnico y a la solución del problema.

These Qi chargers are FANTASTIC. I was in a bad spot with my phone when the plug started being extremely particular about how it was positioned in order to charge. Now, with this Tozo Qi charger I can just drop the phone on the pad and walk away without worry. The color change to let me know it’s charging correctly offers even more peace of mind that I appreciate.
","
Works as it should
","
Does the job it is made to do. Looks cool too.
","
This charges very dlowly, otherwise, I’d be more enthusiastic.
","
Love it so much. I just upgraded to the iPhone 12 pro max and purchased this charger along with earbuds. I must say, wireless charging is a luxury! This charger is so convenient and sleek! I charge my phone, then earbuds. And it’s so affordable. Don’t be on edge by the affordable price, just because it’s cheap, doesn’t mean it does not work. It works!!
","
Extremely thin, light weigh, fast charging, what more can you ask for!?
","
Really nice looking charging pad that I bought as an add-on with wireless earbuds and it's a breeze to setup and use. However the charging capabilities leaves much to be desired due to the fact the only thing it can charge quickly are my earbuds. It will slow charge a phone so don't bother trying.
","
It's sleek, it's compact, it's stylish. Definitely an game changer for wireless charging.Con- it's not as accurate to charge, as in your phone must be placed in exact spot on the charging deck. This should be bigger, the radius should be a little larger to compensate for phones depth and length...keep looking for an larger surface area💯
","
I absolutely love the convenience of this small easy to use wireless charger! It looks nice, I ordered the pink one for myself and the black one for my husband. It seems to be super fast, I put my almost depleted Tozo ear buds on there to charge less than 30 minutes ago and it is more than 2/3 charged now!
","
At first I was thrilled- it is so sleek and looks very nice, and was working great.  I have a case and a popsocket on my phone, it charged through all of that.  But after 2 days, wouldn't even light up or turn on.  Just quit working.I reached out to the company, and they sent me a brand new one for free, no hassle at all.  It has been working perfectly for the past month since I've had it.  Definitely worth the money, makes for a great gift too. Ill update again if it quits, otherwise my review is - I recommend
","
I've been using this for a couple months and I love it. It's very convenient to put my phone or my earbuds on it to charge overnight or while I'm busy. I like the glass design and how it has lights so I know when it's charging, not charging, or trying to connect. The only downside is that charging is a lot slower, but I was expecting that before I purchased it anyway.
","
Purchased this charger along with the company'ss T10 Waterproof Wireless earbuds. I wanted to try the wireless charging that everyone has been talking about and see if I could minimize the electronics I connect to charge every night. It worked better than expected and was very to set up. Also, looks great in my all-white room. Not sure how long it will last, but for the price, it's worth a try.
","
So far it's good. It was able to charge my daughter's iPhone 8 with plastic case and pop up attached to rear ,,,,,. I was impressed that it was able charge with that much separation. I did have to move it around until I found the spot where it charged. I will update if any problems come up.
","
Este cargador para nada me ha funcionado, tuve que comprar uno nuevo ya que al parecer está defectuoso, vivo en la Republica Dominicana y por esta razón no puedo devolverlo, dinero perdido.
","
I like how I can just lay my phone down and it charges instantly!!! Perfect for the bedside nightstand
","
Using the charger on a 2020 iPhone SE.Immediately noticed that the phone charged more rapidly. The phone has a protective case  which does not interfere with the charging efficiency.  Device looks very nice and fits well in my modern decor.Liked it so much i purchased a second model in a different color to Match kitchen counter surface.Incredible price point.Highly recommend!
","
Most elegantly designed producr i own. All glass and aluminum. Flawless workmanship. Fast charges. Glows green when done or waiting. Blue when charging. Superb
","
Order received very quickly. Chargers were well packaged. charging my iPhone XR effectively  inside my life proof case currently.Only downside is that it only ships with a cable no power supply.
","
Product itself is great, however when opening there was a little “remove before using” sticker on the top surface where you place your phone. Upon removal of said sticker  it left a sticky residue that was unnecessarily difficult to remove. Otherwise a good product.
","
Has a very sleek look. I like that there is a green light when my phone isn’t charging and when I place it on it turns blue. Charges well and I’m not sure if you can take with you because it is like glass. Maybe if you keep the packaging you can but overall satisfied.
","
I’m happy I saw this and ordered it.
","
I use this to charge my Google Pixel 5, and as you can see in the picture, it charges fine, and fast too!  It is small, so it does not take up much space at all.  And just like the description says, the magnet does not work, unless it is an iphone, but again, who cares?  It charges quickly and wirelessly.
","
Purchased 2 of these wireless chargers for my mom and me. It worked straight out of the box with no issues. No need to remove the case, simply plug the charger in and place your phone on top. I love the light confirmation. The lights turn from green to blue when charging. It doesn’t seem to work with the army Apple Watch but that isn’t a big deal since I already have a charging station for it. I would definitely recommend the charger to other buyers. Not only does it charge my phone but it looks really sleek as well. Blends in with my decor easily.
","
Easy enough to use - just plug it in to a USB port, place your phone on the pad.  I have a TPU protective case on my phone and it still charges though it doesn't magnetically stick to the phone while in that case.  Not a big deal if you primarily will set your down and let it charge for a bit.
","
I love these chargers! I bought two. They are so easy to pack in your bag and take to work or leave in my corner shelf.  I use it for my wok phone and my personal. One Samsung and one iPhone. The charge is steady and doesn't overheat. I bought a third for my Mom.
","
The lightning port on my iPhone Xs crapped out on me and wouldn’t recognize my power cable. So typical/convenient of Apple considering I’ve had the phone for ~2 years and I just paid it off. Bought this charger as a workaround and, wow! Didn’t realize what I was missing out on. Should have been using this from day one. Don’t overthink it...get you a wireless charger, yesterday!
","
Tozo’s Customer service is amazing! Their emails were so kind & helpful. My charger was not working properly & they are sending me a new. I will definitely buy Tozo products again!,
","
I like that it is flat. The first wireless charger I had was bulky and hard to place the phone on it correctly. This one is small and doesn't take up much room on my nightstand. I got the pink one. It is only pink around the circle shape and bottom. The top of it is white. Wish the whole thing was pink, but other than that, it seems ro work well. It also comes with a one year warranty.
","
Good value. I keep it on my desk and rest my phone on it. So my phone charges while I listen to Audible.
","
There are lots of cheap plastic wireless charging mats out there. I wanted something nice to fit on my desk under my monitors to charge my iPhone with. I have several other “cradle” style wireless chargers , but I needed a flat one so I purchased this one. It looks and feels great in person. Very thin with the right amount of weight to make it feel sturdy. It comes with a 3ft usb A to usb C cable in the box.
","
It’s an ok charging pad, takes a little longer than most and some angles make it impossible to charge but a solid backup at a reasonable price.And it’s Pink!
","
Claims it offers fast charging. However it does not as seen in my screen shot on my phone when it's on the charger. Seems nice otherwise
","
The charger was as easy as can be to plug in and use. We tried the charger with each of our phones (one with a standard protective case, the other is a wallet-case with a front cover) and both were able to charge simply by placing them on the wireless charger. Plus this is a pretty sleek looking device - looks pretty neat on our nightstand!
","
I like the silicone on this one because it grips and sticks easily. Plus the indicator light is more subtle which is nice for a nightstand. Something I was impressed with is that this not only works with charging my AirPods without being finicky about placement on the charger, but it also charges my iPhone which has a card holder with 3 cards on the back! I hadn't bothered trying it because it hasn't worked on other wireless chargers, but even through a silicone card holder and 3 cards it still charged! Great value especially for the price in my opinion!! Would purchase again.
","
Goood i wana mor fast changing
","
Awesome charger works great. Literally just place phone on top of it and it charges right away. Glad I purchased this for my girlfriend as she loves it! Perfect for traveling too because its thin and easy to place in bag without breaking. No more plug in at the bottom to charge, just place on top of charger and walk away!
","
I was honestly shocked when I opened this package. It is extremely well made. Feels solid in the hand, the top feels like glass (although I think it is plastic?) and there is aluminum around the edge. It is perhaps the thinnest wireless charging pad I have seen. The LED indicators are very tastefully used. It includes a charging cable but not brick. Absolutely love this wireless charging pad.
","
While it is a sleek little thing, I immediately had issues. First, it was not mirrored like the graphics say it is. The top is like a piece of glass, the back of which is painted white instead of metal like a true mirror. My second and more pressing issue is that it DOES NOT charge my Samsung at 10W, despite having the proper adapter to do so. No LEDs light up and it's unresponsive when I put my phone on the pad. It works with my standard 5W charger adapter though. Just to make sure, I plugged the super fast charger directly into the phone and it worked, so it's not an issue with the cord or adapter, just with the pad. It's not the worst thing since I have the time to let it slow charge on my nightstand while I'm asleep but I paid for a mirrored pad that can charge super fast and I didn't get that :(
","
Sleek looking and nice and thin. Charged my phone even through my thick otter box case. Fast charging and easy to use. Did not come with a plug just a usb cord but I knew that when I purchased it.  I plug it in a power cord with usb connecting plugs.  So that was not an issue.  Little blue light that is covered by the phone. Price was reasonable and so far I’m pleased with this purchase.
","
Great for wireless earbuds.  Gets hot when i use it to charge iPhone11.  Does come with power cord in box. Overall pleased with purchase.
","
I got this charger for easily sharing charging capability in my living room.  I just put this in the room, and it is really easy for nearly everyone who comes over to my house to charge their phones as long as they have a compatible phone; switching between charging phones is easier then ever now (especially between phones with different charger cable needs).  The design is slim and sleek and the charging is fast and easy, just place the phone on the charging unit, and the phone begins to charge; The light indicator lets you know when your phone is fully charged.Overall, great product!
","
This is pretty slylic little charger.  Looks very nice and it does what it saids.  I hope it could charge faster but I'm happy with it.
","
I have a One Plus 9 and it charges it lightening fast. Only drawback is it is slippery. Could use some sort of texture.
","
It seems to be working great but I’ve only had it for a few days.  I can give an updated review when I see how it works a month from now.
","
Great price! Works great and very compact
","
This is my second, shall we say, economical charger.  The first was also under $20.  But this one is a disappointment.  I have an iphone mini.  I would think that small size would be in its favor, but when I place the phone on the charger, it very often does not get a ""connection"".  I have to move it around to find the sweet spot where the charger lights up.  When I come back to it, sometimes there is a good charge, but way too often, it has not charged at all.  No, its not the case; I have a very slim clear plastic case.  Works with all wireless chargers I have encountered.  It may be a single defective unit, but its a dud.  I paid $10 so its not worth the return process.  Just sticking with my original.
","
**UPDATE** I’ve had this a month or so now and I’ve honestly unplugged and put it in a drawer. It was getting more and more sensitive on where I had to place my phone for it to start charging and I got seriously annoyed. The whole point of me getting this was so I wouldn’t have to mess around with anything, but this was no different than hunting for a cord and messing plugging in (time wise).It could be a pricey coaster I guess.***Came with easy instructions, (though it is self explanatory I believe). Also came with a code to scan so you can get a 1 year warranty, was super quick and easy to navigate that as well. The phone does need to be smack in the middle of the plate in order to work, which is a bit of an annoyance, but not a major issue. Great item for price!
","
Starts charging perfectly every time unlike my other two wireless charges that you have to place the phone just right so they start charging. With one click the Tozo wireless charger starts and works every time. It is much more compact than my older chargers and cant wait to use it for travel. Works with standard apple iPad chargers well.
","
I'm really enjoying this charger so far. It charges my smasung s10 like it's supposed to. I do wish the cord was longer but most cords that come like this are too short. You do need a fast charging box if you want it to fast charge your Samsung product. Otherwise, it's easy, convenient and compact enough to not disturb my workspace.
","
Love this. Bought 2. They worked with an iPhone 8 in case and also with my iPhone 12 Pro MAX. It does charge fairly slowly, but its very sleek and VERY flat.  Cool little light changes colors when there is a connection so no wondering.  This thing beats the other products out there IMO and its cheaper!!
","
It has a sleek and elegant design and it works with my AirPods pro and iPhone 11 Pro. I have a credit card phone case and it even works with the case on (with 3 cards in it), which is great. I usually have to remove the case or some of the cards for other wireless chargers. It has green and blue indicator lights, which I don’t care for, but I think most normal people would prefer to have them. Make note that the package includes a USB cable but no wall outlet adapter. Overall, a great product. Easy to use. Works well.

 El diseño y colores me encantaron, solo tienes que poner el teléfono a la mitad para que cargue bien y es bueno aclarar que debes tener un conector que sea de carga rápida también para que puedas cargar rápidamente tu teléfono, si tienes el famoso “cuadrito” que vendía generalmente Apple solo será una carga en tiempo normal
","
I am very pleased with this item. It’s very lightweight and easy to take anywhere I may go. I havnt had it for very long but so far it’s works great.
","
Great especially for the price. Make sure you have the USB-C plug fully into the port on the side of the disk. I didn’t at first and it kept falling out. I thought it was a defect then realized it hadn’t snapped into the disk. Phone needs to be placed close to center to charge but the edge lights turn blue when you got it right - fool proof. I like the lights and the disk is slim. Charges my iPhone just as well as a cable to charging block. I bought another for my wife’s office.
","
This is a great charging product. It doesn't charge as fast as the new chargers, however the cube alone is $35+ so this worked great for our phones. Super easy to use. The light changes color when it's charging.
","
Great charges had it for a few months and still keep going I typically bring it to my office because my regular wall plug in doesn’t work anymore thank God for wireless charging! Definitely recommend this!
","
This is the biggest disappointment it is slow charging, if you don’t set it down just right it will not charge and stops charging for no reason.  iPhone 13 Pro and doesn’t charge well.
","
I bought this because reviews said it charges phones and such fast but it doesn't at all. My phone showed it would take 3.5 hours to get a full charge from 20% battery.I emailed the company about this and never heard back.Do not buy!
","
This charger is sleek (very thin!), looks nice, and charges quickly (my Samsung Galaxy S10 registers it as a fast charging device). Comes with a cable that seems to be of solid quality.Note that at the time of writing, some models appear to have a solid reflective surface, while others have grippy (silicone?) surface. I chose the gray model which is the non-reflective kind, and I'm very happy with it.Note that the reflective models appear to have a light that shines through the surface, but the silicone model has a small, single point of light coming out of the front of the device.
","
What can I say. TOZO really out did themselves. After I purchase my TOZO T10  earbuds. I received a gift from TOZO refunding me the full amount for the wireless charger. Not only does my charge my earbuds charger but also my GALAXY NOTE 9 cellphones. This is literally I killed 2 birds with just one stone (Metaphorly) hahahahaha Thank you and I am very grateful to have found this great deal on line. They are very professional and prompt. I got my stuff within a few days. BUY BUY BUY! is a most folks. You will not be disappointed I know I am NOT!
","
Does charge well
","
Thin profile, easy for phone placement and charging
","
It's thin, it does charge your phone, BUT, 2 things:-the connection at the base for the charging cord is very sensitive to movement,  which is very annoying.-not fast charging, I have a s20 & I find it's better just to use this charger for night time charging.
","
**Update**  The company is sending a replacementThe charger works fine but once it reaches 100% it won't hold it there. I'll keep this one as a backup but won't use it every night.
","
So simple & fast. The only thing that could make this even better is if it also kept my coffee cup warm  ; ).  All right ... someone come up with a design!
","
Since this is also meant to be for magnetic charge, the size is understandable. Is a bit thick but nothing that gets in the way. It would be nice if the ""block"" or actual plug charger came with this. I'd assume it would come with one since I was purchasing the whole charger, not just the wire or something. Either than that, it's great.
","
My phone has an Otterbox case on it, and it charges it Instantly. This should be a gift to anybody. Perfect Charger and, might I add...., can be used with a ""Speed"" charging plug, so it does support Fast Charging. Too, will not forget this Brand. I need another one for myself, the wife will love this!!
","
so far so good. i been using this wireless charger for about a week and has performed a great job. my coworker want to buy one too but they don’t have a newer phone that can be charged wireless. works perfect with my iPhone XR. I really wanted something like this wireless charger because my old iPhone 6 and 7 both broke down from the charging port and with this wireless charger I don’t have to worry about plugging in. just lay the phone down and the charger does the rest. it comes with warranty which makes this charger even better. i recommend this product and will buy again.
","
So far it works great. Have only used it for a short while so I can't comment on charge speed but I only intend to use it at my desk for some supplemental charging while working. Appearance is very nice and thin. Looks just like the product pictures. The provided cable is pretty short, maybe 3ft, so you may need a longer one depending on location.
","
My wireless charger came quickly and in perfect condition. It charges quickly and comes with a charging chord but no adapter to plug it in an outlet (as the product description says). It easily charged my wireless headphones and I'm excited to use it on my new phone when it comes in! It also comes with a free 1 year warranty which is a nice bonus.
","
I was never really a fan of this charging station because since I bought it, I noticed that it takes a very long time to charge my phone. Three to four hours from 15%-100%. It was fine for using at bed time because it could sit on the charging station all night and be ready in the morning. That lasted only a few months because now, when I wake up, it has maybe charged 25% all night. It says it's connected, it says it's charging, the light changes color from green to blue so I know it's on there correctly. But it's no longer supplying enough juice to my phone. Thankfully I still have the charger my phone came with, so I can plug that in while I'm getting ready and be fine for the day. However, that makes this charger obsolete for me. It's going in the trash
","
Got this because it was one of the cheapest options and had decent ratings, and now I can see why.  The first impression was that the quality of the charger is better than most I've encountered.  Its hefty, feels very solid in the hand and on a surface, with a well-done chamfered edge and great styling, plus a USB-C cable to boot!  Looks good, works great, and was one of the best priced wireless chargers on Amazon!
","
This is a great option when you have different types of phones. I took this to work in all of us can charge our phones
","
I first thought I was getting the W1 so a bit let down but does work fine for my AirPods and perhaps something else small. Not ideal for larger items but not a nad charger to travel with.Like the W1, these  DO NOT come with the wall so one must also be purchased and or use an existing plug that the w1 cord can plug into.
","
looks good and overall works ok. You cannot use this with a phone case on, but that goes for most of these types of chargers.
","
My item seems to be malfunctioning, but Tozo Customer Service was very responsive and immediately said they would send me a replacement.  I'm very happy with their solution and with their customer service and attentiveness.
","
Obviously, very convenient. Easy to use right out of the box. You will need the adapter for the wall outlet for the USB cable. So, get one out of your drawer full, right. I also have a bi-fold leather with a protective case on my iPhone 8+ and sometimes it's a slight pause to position the phone for charging. I'm satisfied completely.
","
amazing amzing charger. very modern and fits in a tiny place. its very skinny which i love too. the only probem ive had with it is that its not one you can just place onto and it charges. i need to move my phone around to find where the charge will take place. i found that out the hard way. i just placed it on my bedside with my phone ontop and i woke up with no charge at all. i learned i need to move it alittle to where it turned blue and the chraging sign came up! so make sure that you place it right!
","
I like the silicone on this one because it grips and sticks easily. Plus the indicator light is more subtle which is nice for a nightstand. Something I was VERY impressed with is that this not only works with charging my AirPods without being finicky about placement on the charger, but it also charges my iPhone which has a card holder with 3 cards on the back! I hadn't bothered trying it because it hasn't worked on other wireless chargers, but even through a silicone card holder and 3 cards it still charged! Great value especially for the price in my opinion!! Would purchase again.
","
I didn't realize I didn't have to order it to charge the earbuds I purchased. Works fine.
","
MagSafe magnet works only with iPhone 12 as mentioned but can still charge by touch as the other TOZO wireless charger. I attached a photo of it charging my TOZO wireless earbuds. The power cable is about 2’3”. It took about 2.5 hrs to charge from 0% from a laptop plug. Doesn’t include charging block, I recommend a fast-charger block of your choice.
","
After losing another charger cable to a feisty cat, I finally decided to get a wireless charger for my phone. After reading all of the great reviews on this wireless charger, I ordered one in Rose Gold. It is beautiful and sleek, and it charges my phone quickly. It is a very slim charging pad; my second photo shows that it is just about the same size as a standard felt-backed coaster. The lights in the charging pad are not too bright, and you can cover them with your phone at night if it bothers you. Overall I am very pleased with this charger!
","
I bought this wireless charger for my husband as a gift.  He is very happy with it and uses it all the time. I like the design and so far it works great to charge our android phones.  I would definitely recommend this charger to anyone looking for a wireless charger to replace their old corded charging system.  The price was reasonable too!
","
Very happy with this charger. I purchased this to have at my desk at work and it looks super sleek and charges great so far. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a cordless charger. Note that the cable for this charger doesn’t have an outlet attachment, works for me because I can plug it into my computer, but if you are wanting to plug it into the wall make sure you have the outlet attachment.
","
works great. my only complaints is your phone has to be sitting on it just right and it takes about an hour longer to fully charge my phone than my normal cable.
","
Looks good, feels well built.  Does not include AC adapter only a cable.  The lights stay on all the time so not good for areas that need to be dark.  iPhone X and XS sense the charger quickly but does not charge quickly. This may be to the AC adapter I am using.  Would be great if one that matched the device specs was included instead of trying to guess what is needed.  Not a complete solution but looks nice.
","
It seems to work just fine, I'm a little worried about a lack of padding may cause some scratches to my phone but I think I'll use a case with this charger.
","
I go through a lot of phone cords. Wish I had bought one of these sooner. This charger is compact and can fit anywhere. It charged my LG G8 thinq quickly. I like the slim feature and the high quality of the product. (And they have tons of color options!) I would definitely buy it again.
","
Charging power is ok. It took about 5hrs to full charge my iPhone 11.

This is my first wireless charger I've bought to use with my iPhone XS. The order included the charging plate, cord, as well as the plug. I love how sleek this looks on my side table (I bought it in gold). When plugged in, the plate lights up green (see picture) and when a phone is being charged, the plate lights up blue. The only thing I had to be careful about was that I had a magnetic sticker on the back of my iPhone case that got hot when I put it on the charger plate so I have to take my case off. I'd highly recommend this product!
","
I’m extremely satisfied with this charger. It is quite thin for a charging pad and the color options available make it easy to find the right one. Blends in very nicely with my bedside table and office desk. There are some sticky pads on the base that seem to work very well. I was originally going to try and secure it to my table but so far it stays put so well I don’t even need to. The charger plugs in via usb-c so very easy to set up.
","
Great wireless charging pad!  Has a big surface area and looks great on my nightstand!
","
TOZO has yet to disappoint me. I’ve had a few different earbuds by them, a power bank, and now this wireless charger. Upon opening the box, you can tell it’s just a high quality object with a beautiful aesthetic in mind. The charging works great (never had a wireless charger before—what have I been missing out on!?) and it’s beyond easy to use. Very happy with this purchase!
","
I travel for work and spend my nights in a hotel. I was looking for a thin charge pad for my S21 plus. This fit the bill as to what I wanted. The first time I set my phone down on the pad I recieved a warning notice stating the charger does not support my phones high speed wireless charging. It's a Samsung Galaxy S21 for god sake. So while it'll charge, its slow until you plug in. My first TOZO purchase that I'm not happy with. If you want to use fast charge and you have a galaxy, look elsewhere
","
I first got one of these for my boyfriend, who could NEVER remember to plug his phone in at night. Once it arrived I immediately got jealous, and needed one of my own. I like how slim and sturdy this charger is, and the color selections are nice (we have the black and the silver ones). The light on the surface that changes color to let you know it's actually charging is really handy, and not too bright at all. Overall, great product!
","
Umm well it can charge your cell, just need to lift it up and back down, or rotate it, or take the case off, and have it perfectly centered. Pick one of those and you can charge your cellphone. I have an iPhone X and my wife as well, it will not work on her otterbox. But every other brand she tried of her families does... works with my cell case but it has to lay on it perfectly.. overall it's a no go.
","
I picked this up for two reasons...it looked great and it was ""fast charging"".  I can't complain about the looks...definitely slick and a great design.  My only compliant is that it doesn't seem to really be a ""Fast Charging"" unit.  When I plug my phone directly into the standard Apple cord, it charges much more quickly.  I used the same AC usb adapter for both tests.  I am going to keep it because I am really using it at night, but if you are looking to use it more regularly, just be aware it isn't as fast as I expected.
","
I have had so many issues with needing to replace power cords because of the wires being bent or broken. So, I purchased this wireless charger. Not only does this charger solve my power cord issues. It is easy to set up, just plug it in and you are good to go. Plus it looks so much better than cables do on my desk.
","
Seriously, why did it take me so long to start using wireless charging? I love it so much I bought one for my boyfriend to have as well. They charge our phones great, I have an iPhone and he has a Pixel (with the case on)! Also the light on it is very nice but not bright enough to disrupt sleep. Will buy more for other rooms of my house!
","
It’s really very good product to charge wirelessly.The support team are very nice and very helpful to solve my problems when I contact them . I really appreciate the help that provide me while I faced a charging problem, they very quick response to my complain and sent me a new one. Thank you so much TOZO team.
","
Great charger for new iPhones. You don't have to worry about placing the phone into the right position, because it snaps into place to make a perfect connection. It works with other wireless charging phones/earbuds too, but not magnetically. The cable has a USB-C connector. Charges faster than I'm used to, which is great. It fits into mag charge cases well. Looks nice, too.
","
Works well though smaller than expected and could be stronger magnet . Thought it stopped working but turns out that was an Apple problem where the phone needed to be restarted for all wireless charging.
","
It's best looking wireless charger out there, hands down. So thin and sleek. Only downside - LED is too strong and it can distract your sleep if you're sensitive. I put LED blocking tape and it does job.
","
This is very good looking wireless charger, bit thicker than their later version but plus side is the non-slick surface. LED light is bit bright but can be covered by LED blocker which you want to buy separately.
","
Update: bought a second one for my daughter on July 11. Both are working great.I’ve used this for about 24hrs now, and I’m very satisfied with it! Zero fuss setting up. Easy to use. I only give 4 stars as it doesn’t come with wall adaptor (as expected but would have been nice).
","
At first I thought the design, the packaging, and the time that I received it was perfect. However after using it for a couple of weeks, my phone does not hold a charge. For some reason, when I use this particular device to charge my phone, even though I leave it on the device all night long. By noon or 1 o’clock, my phone is dead. If I plug it in to the regular Charger, my phone still has a charge when I go to plug it in at night. Not so with this particular device/charger.
","
TOZO W1 Wireless Charger: Its a nice size and very thin. the charging cord has a standard USB male plug to connect to a charging cube. The lights are tolerable when used on a nightstand next to a bed, one can rotate the phone a bit to cover part of the lights.  With eyes closed, I don't notice anything.........
","
Era un regalo pero la persona a quien se lo regalé le fascinó bastante y me dijo que ella misma lo volvería a comprar 👍👍👍👍
","
The best one
","
This wireless charger works great for smart phones and wireless headphones. It’s so convenient. All you have to do is put your device on it and let it do it’s job. Charges quick as well.
","
This charger looks very smooth and fits well in a contemporary spacw. It charges very slow however. I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 which charges extremely fast with a regular charger. However with this charger it only charges around 10% every 20-30 minutes. Works for an overnight bedside charger, but if youre looking for something speedy to have in your living room for example I'd look for a more expensive, better working wireless charger. Overall, worth the $11 but doesn't work great.
","
I have another wireless charger that my Samsung S10e will only connect to when it is positioned ""just right"".  This always connects through my Otter Box every time no matter how it is oriented or centered.
","
Very very slim wireless charger. Top is a glossy black color. Charges using USB-C. It will wireless charge iPhones at a 7.5w max, not sure about Androids. Does not come with the block that plugs into the wall, but we have a bunch of those laying around. Bottom padding so it doesn't slide around. Overall a great wireless charger and modern looking and won't take up too much space.
","
It works
","
Super small. I had a charger similar to this in the past but didnt care for it due to the size. I got this one because it was smaller and didnt take up room on my work bench. I pick up my phone a lot to look stuff up when Im in the garage and solved the plug unplug issue I would always have.
","
Not as fast as my Morphe, but gets the job done as backup. Definitely more attractive than other chargers. Would definitely recommend for the price.
","
This item is made very nice, almost apple like.  Charges my iphone X at 1300mah, similar speed to a charge cable.  Lights are not a problem in my opinion. If you set your phone so the lights are on the sides of the phone (like they show in the picture) the lights will cast a glow on the ceiling at night.  I prefer to place my phone so it covers the lights, then the disc has a faint glow from the led’s.  Well, at least it does for the white version.  I’m very happy with the product so far.
","
Yes it’s easy to slide into a bag and travel with but after 3 weeks of actual use (mostly only on the weekend) so probably 10 uses it stopped charging. I put my phone on it after it had died expecting it to charge my phone. I came back 2-3 hours later and it was still dead. Had to go out and buy another charger.Update: turns out I had a defective one and the company reached out to me almost immediately! I’m highly impressed with how fast they responded and they are sending me a new charger. I’m excited to get the new one.
","
Wish I bought this a long long time ago! How convenient and easy to use... I gifted this to my boyfriend who has been having a difficult time using a regular charger because his phones charging input has malfunctioned and doesn’t charge as easily bc the charger always just falls out! I’ll be buying plenty more in the future. Love it.
","
So I bought the first one for a Christmas gift for our college daughter and she loved.  Little did I know that while she was home on break my husband was using it more than the kid because he really liked it.  So I bought him one too, not in pink.  Very happy with both purchases.
","
The charger is easy to set up with the included USB-C/USB cable. It looks nice on the nightstand and charges my iPhone well. I don’t love that the LED lines stay lit all the time, even when no device is charging, but this is a matter of taste. This charger seems like good value for money and I’m pleased with it. The manufacterer offers a 1 year warranty, too.
","
I have an Android maybe that's why it didn't work. Idk ?
","
Best used for an “over night” charge because it shuts off the charge after full battery to not waste life use for the future. If you need a fast charge I recommend using the original plug in. The wireless charger does take longer. Overall decent to have around the house but not for only source of charging.
","
I bought this charger to charge my phone and or my airpods over night while sleeping. Its very cute and slim if you want a more aesthetically pleasing charger pad, I have the white and rose gold. Very simple and easy to use. It comes with a charging cord but not a cube for the wall. charges up fast and chargerd my airpods fully, no problem. Its small so I cant fit multiple accessories on it at once. Very affordable, less than $20 and works great.
","
small and compact and works as it stated so far.
","
I couldn’t find a wireless charger I liked until I found this! It’s sleek design and the various colors is what sold me. I got the green to match my green iPhone 11. It was easy to set up and all I did was place my phone on the pad, it connected & started charging. Super simple!
","
Unlike other chargers, this one worked just fine with my Galaxy S7 and its thick Rockform case.  I like that the color change is pretty obvious too so I know visually whether its charging or not.  It charges pretty quickly, too.Also my Rockform has a magnet on it, and when I put it on the charger, the magnet makes it stick to the charging pad.  I found this to be a pleasant surprise; others may not want that kind of functionality.Good job, Tozo!
","
It seems slower than a cord but it’s easy to use.
","
Love it just set my phone on it no plugging my phone in and it charges fast
","

This wireless charging pad is a slim disc with a usb-c port. Just plug in the cable it came with there and the other end into your regular wall charger and you’re good to go. I can see it being very handy for travels.
","
Amazing product. Charging time is much faster than my old Qi charger. It has a very nice sleek design. The aluminum unibody is very very thin.  With the black glass top, it just look amazing. The indicator light is just right not too bright and not to dim. Put my iphone on start charge right away. What else need to say. I would highly recommend this product.
","
Very happy with this purchase - nice design and well made - sleek, slim and doesn't look like a plastic wireless charger - within minutes of receiving it was charging - however, longevity is the one thing that alludes this type of charger, so time will tell the real quality and design story of the product - first impression, I would recommend to anyone looking for a wireless charger
","
Me encantó esa compra. Funciona muy bien, lo que sí me parece es que queda un poco floja la entrada usb, pero si lo tienes un lugar fijo, cae de maravilla. Lo tengo en mi mesita de noche junto a la cama y se ve súper lindo.Realmente muy bonito, útil y funcional. Lo compré para uso personal, pero sin duda es buena opción para un regalo (junto con un dulce u otro detallito).
","
Very easy to use
","
I bought this to charge bc a lot of the chargers you plug into the devices seem to bend and sometimes get damaged and this is just really simple plug it in to the wall and set the case on top and it’s good to go.
","
Love the look of this charger!! Unfortunately it doesn’t charge my Apple Watch or my iPads but it works great for my iPhone 12 max. Definitely would recommend.
","
It's pretty great overall, convenient too. Sometimes getting the placement correct can be sorta frustrating cause then it won't charge your device. But overall I'd say it was worth it!
","
I got this wireless charger (my first), plugged it in, and it worked flawlessly.  If you use a powerful A/C adapter, it will fast charge. Even on my lower powered USB aux port it charges my phone fairly quickly. The lights are helpful. It is a sleek looking unit, one of the nicer looking ones I've seen. Everything is exactly as listed and shown here on Amazon.  I am  very pleased with it. A great value and a very nice product.
","
Works great! Very stylish.
","
Dislike it takes long to charge but it charges. It’s great for traveling and easy to use
","
Always was hesitant to try these but im glad a finally did. This wireless charger is GREAT to have next to your bed or on your desk in your office. Every time I sit down to work I put my phone on this pad and I leave with a full charge.
","
I’m pleased with this charger, I’ve only had it a couple days, but seems to char my phone and headphones quickly. And so easy to not have to deal with plugging my phones/headphones in and out. You simply place what you’re wanting to charge, down on it. It looks super nice too, very good quality.
","
This is supposed to be a wireless charger yet it doesn't even work unless it's PLUGGED IN TO YOUR CHARGER... It's ridiculous. Plug your phone into the phone charger OR, plug your phone charger into the WIRELESS CHARGER and sit your phone and other devices, WITH PLUGS, on top of it.. Waste of money
","
So far so good! I bought it to charge  a pair of their T6 earbuds. Works great! It doesn't come with a wall adapter, just a USB cord. I did try this with the wall charger for my galaxy phone and it does fast wireless charging which is also fantastic. Great product, and you can't beat the price.
","
Super cheap and excellent quality. Easy to set up and just place your phone on for charging. I don't have to worry about remembering to plug it in because I placed it where I put my phone every night. I love the design and the color options. Will definitely be buying more to keep in my office and other places in my house!
","
I bought this for convenience in charging. The only thing I could put of this is frustration and a dead phone. I place my phone on it to charge and 2 out of 10 times it charges. The other 8 times, I have come back to a dead phone. I may not like cords, but I like a charged phone so back to cords it is.
","
Very disappointed in this! I always wanted a wireless charger and just got a phone that is compatible with it and I was disappointed to see it charging slow and I have to move it around another to get it to start charging, can't just sit it on there and go..
","
Aesthetically pleasing but hardly functional. I use it to charge my Note10+ and after an hour or so it stops charging. I thought it was my phone but my earbuds also don't get a complete charge and neither does my Galaxy Watch. You have to move the item just a smidge and it'll start charging again. I'll use it as a cup holder :0)
","
I purchased a few of these chargers and they truly look sharp and high quality. Make sure that you use the supplied USB-C cable because it's very thin where it plugs into the wireless base so it sits level.  Other cables have a beefier plug and will not allow it to sit properly. Overall, a great buy.
","
I just got mine yesterday 3/30/2022. I was excited about it being wireless because i wanted to use it for my office without having cords along my desk, but it seems to only work while it is charging. I took it off the charger and the little green light on the side turns off, I tried placing my phone on it to see if it would charge and it wouldn't. The only way my phone will charge is if this device is plugged in to an outlet. Very disappointed. It does look cool tho ill give it that but that is not the reason why i ordered it.
","
Es my bueno y extremadamente resistente. Se me cayó desde un quinto piso y no le pasó nada. Siguió trabando perfectamente.
","
I would give this charger a 5 star review but I bought it specifically to charge the T6 wireless ear buds and my cell phone, but the charger makes the head phones very hot and I'm concerned I'll ruin my ear buds. It charges my Samsung galaxy S9 phone without issue or overheating it, so I will keep this charger. Not sure why the headphones over heat though.
","
I purchased this on July 31, 2021 to charge my Tozo ear buds. It has stopped working. No green light when plugged in and will not charge.'Love the look and the pink color.
","
This charger is very slow. It is not charging even when I am using my iphone and I see the battery percentage hoes down
","
This thing works...  Exactly what I hoped.  Plug it in, set your phone on the pad, and it charges as it is supposed to do.  The pad has a light that turns blue when the charge is happening.  I opened the box, plugged it in, using 3A charging adapter, and off it goes.  2 hours later, I ordered another.
","
It is compact and thing easy to use. But I don’t like the light
","
I purchased this in January thinking it would be great.  After struggling with it recognizing my phone I gave up and pushed it to the back of my catch all (desk.)  I have found that I have to remove my phone case to get it to register at all, and it's not a thick useful case.  I also have learned that it is not a fast charger so it charges ""at a standard rate.""  Very disappointing.  I was hoping this would be a go-to item for traveling but I am very much let down by it.  So, charging power is crud.  Travel adaptability is crud since it's useless.  It's easy to use I guess if you're okay with taking the time to disassemble your case/phone and wait 14 hours for it to get charged. (hands up emoji?)
","
This charging pad works well. I primarily use it to charge the earbud cases for my truly wireless earbuds. Which works great for that.When charging a phone, however, it's a little finnicky to get the phone placed just right on the pad. However, once you get used to the location of the phone on the pad, it works well.
","
Great sleek charger... glad I got two... works as well with a phone case as it does without. It’s a great product, as described, that indicates while charging.  Everyone in this house seems to think if a phone charger cable is in sight, it’s up for grabs. leaving others chasing down chargers...Even the phone charger “cleptos” appreciate the ease, effectiveness and convenience of a charging “station”.
","
New to the TOZO family, I wasn't sure what to expect from this disc charger. I also purchased the TOZO T6 earbuds. I am quite surprised by the price point vs. quality in either of these items. The charger is sleek, stylish, and well constructed. With the high-speed charger source, the Wireless Disc, T6 Buds, my phone, All charge just fine. From here on in, I'm trusting TOZO.Chuck Klockow
","
I purchased this wireless charger for the price and was surprised by the great quality and simplicity that this charger provides. It's easy to use and charges faster than the Samsung charger I have. I've completely switched to this one and would recommend it for anyone looking for a simple wireless charger.Recommendation: Buy this as it's great quality for the pricePros:- Simple wireless charger- Lights up according to charge level of device- Quality charger and well constructed- One year warranty- Rubber grips on the bottom to keep it from slippingCons: None
","
Males it Easier to grab and go especially in a rush
","
Did not work with my Samsung S21 Ultra
","
I just got this charger for Christmas today and so far it seems to be great! I just plugged it in and I love that it lights up to show charging and not charging.
","
I have note 8, it charges without cover.Friend has s8, ir charges with coverIt doesnt charge g3
","
I like the look, very neat, the only problem I’ve my phone in a case so it charges a bit slower.
","
The charger looks very sleek and works just as advertised. It charged an IPhone SE about 10% per 10 minutes. We had to use a more powerful AC adapter so it can charge faster. We noticed it charges slower when using the standard iPhone AC adapter. It even charges my iPhone XR with a case and a pop socket on it!
","
waited over a month for this, ordered pink. And just the outside is pink, the top is white. Just disappointed it was not what was advertised. Works fine.
","
I purchased the Tozo wireless charging station and USB charger on a whim (how much effort is it to plug a charging cable into the headset?). I was wrong!  For a small investment this item makes charging so much simpler.  I am looking forward to seeing other electronic devices they make!
","
EDIT: TOZO reached out to me and offered a refund for the product so I’m happy with the service! Adding stars for that!The product lights up as if it's working but doesn't charge. May not be for all phone types, did not work for my iPhone 7 or my mom's android.
","
I received my charger in black of course to match my Apple SE lol I plugged in the usb c and the green lights came on placed my phone on charger went to blue  It’s definitely worth the money  !
","
I think my only complaint is that there isn’t much gold you can see, it’s almost pointless to order the trim. Besides that, I like that the cable is white and matches the top of the charger :)
","
It is very stylish. Nice and large. Although it would look better if the whole charger was colored too. Not just the sides and bottom with a white top.
","
Quick charge. Easy ... plop my iPhone down and it charges while I’m using desktop computer. I like the length of the usb charging cable. I like the look of the charger and the green lines when lit up. It didn’t work for the Samsung tablet that I needed it for but it gave me a charger for my bedroom nightstand.
","
It takes longer than a charger you would plug in.  Many morning I’d wake up to a near dead battery, not sure if mine has a short but it just stops charging.  I have had to unplug & replug, change outlets to get it to charge.  I wouldn’t trust it in dire situations.
","
Works great. Make sure you verify you are using a good working charge plug. Had to switch charge plugs due to getting blinking green light instead of solid blue light for charging, even when my old plug used to work on my old wireless charger. Fast charging works great. Looks good in an office setting. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.
","
I like the convenience, ease of use. This and other wireless charging pads I have do not work for phones completely dead. In that case, I need to use the regular charger with a plug. Other than that, I have several of these in the house.

 I purchased this in hopes to charge my daughters tablet since her charging port has been acting up (it supports wireless charging) but as you can see from the short clip video, it just blinks. I tried my iPhone 13 pro max and it also did not work. I tried my daughters AirPods and it didn’t work either. The only thing it did sort of charge/detect was my other daughters iPhone 12 mini but it would detect it and then stop and detect it again and stop. So A for effort but 2 starts for not being fully functional for different devices. (Samsung tablet, iPhone 13 pro max, AirPods)
","
I bought this for my husband & he carries it under everywhere with it.I think it’s one his favorite items I’ve ever bought him.Charges well and looks cool
","
This charger is awesome. It is discreet and works great with my wireless ear buds and phone. It has to be plugged in to use so I don't know how traveling will work but it's small so it would be very easy to take it to and fro. All in all it's a great little charger. 🙂
","
I like the idea of having a wireless charger. This was recommended to me and I’m looking forward to seeing how it works.Looks like a great product!
","
At first I had issues where it would not charge through my Apple Magsafe case, but I figured out that it was because the magnets in my car mount were interfering.  Once I removed the magnets in my mount it worked perfectly.
","
I just received this today I'm writing a review as part of the warranty and registration system Hope to add more maybe when I've got to use the product.
","
This is a very attractive looking charger, and at a great price.  There is a choice of several colors to match any decor.  It’s an effective and convenient wireless charger , and small enough to tuck away for travel.  It’s very nice not to have to hassle with plugging in and unplugging my phone anymore. Highly recommended.
","
The charger has been working flawlessly so far.
","
Its durable and nice feeling, but the charging speed leaves much to be desired. If you want this to be your new main charger be sure to get it on there very early.
","
This device is incredibly thin and does a great job charging my phone
","
Got this for my husband's Galaxy 10 and it charges quickly. It doesn't charge my Pixel 4 but I didn't get it for me. He's very happy with it.
","
This charges my Samsung Galaxy S20FE very quickly.  I was surprised how fast. I have 3 of these now. 2 at home and 1 on my desk at work.  Don't have to move the phone around to start charging like I had to do with another charger.I would definitely recommend this charger.
","
This charger is so sleek and straightforward. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to go back to a traditional wired charger.So far, I'm very happy. Charging is rapid and the product is lovely (I got the rose gold). I'll update this review if I find that the product doesn't continue to work well over time.
","
It worked fine for about three months. Now, it blinks green even with no phone. It does not switch to charging mode when a phone is placed on it. Nice while it lasted but not worth the price for only three months of use.
","
Very slim and modern looking.  Nice green lights to show the charging pad has power.  Changes to blue when your device is actually charging.  Build seems to be of good quality.  Comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable.  Need to find a higher output USB adapter to take advantage of the higher charge output.  I do recommend that though if your phone is capable because without it, its truly a trickle charge.  Got it on a cyber deal so price was pretty good.  I'm happy with the purchase.
","
First, I received the charger in record speed.  I received it 4 days before anticipated arrivalNext, the items was exactly as described. It came with an instruction manual with how to set it up.I love the simplicity of just placing my phone down on the charger. No plugging it in or nothing. Now I can charger my phone and use my earbuds(non wireless) at the same time while I’m at work.It charges my iPhone and my spouses android! Super awesome and well worth the purchase. I hope it lasts a long time!
","
Ok i know i was purchasing a wireless charger. But still SURPRISED me. Lol Also love the fact that i can easily connect it to any of my phone cables. It's so simple and lightweight. which, makes it easy to move/carry around and/or slip into my wallet bag. This is my top 4 favorite purchase from Amazon.Using it for my new iPhone and as long as it works great,.i'm happy^^
","
This wireless charger is perfect to take along in your computer bag when you travel. The shape and size fit neatly into most pockets on your bag. When combined with a fast-charging AC adapter, it charges by cell phone nearly as quickly as plugging the phone in directly while providing the convenience of being able to simply pick it up without worrying about disconnecting a wire should I need to use the phone.
","
This thing charges well, but it needs some sort of rubbering around it, my phone literally just slides off of it because it has a glass back.
","
Didn't know much about wireless chargers but needed one. Bought a different one. Didn't like it. Gave it to my daughter. Bought this one. Love this one. Bought another one. I think I'll get another one too! Two thumbs up. Good product at a great price.
","
I've been looking for a phone charger that isn't too bulky nor stands out like a sore thumb with my minimal office design, and this is the perfect one! It blends in with my desk and is super slim so stays out of sight when not in use. Can be used while traveling as well while barely taking up space.
","
Funciona de maravilla, aunque pedí color negro y llegó blanco.
","
I owned this product for only a few days and it has died and completely shut off. However, it does come with a warranty so I will see where that takes me.
","
This is an awesome charger! The materials are flawless and very high quality. It genuinely feels like it could cost much more than it does! I was able to put it in the cubby of my 2018 Subaru Crosstrek Limited & can now charge my phone wirelessly. I have the CARPLAY2AIR wireless CarPlay in my car now, so this completes my setup!
","
Works great 👍
","
Works with case on phone super convienent
","
The wireless charger is very easy to use. The only issue I had was that I thought that the LED indicator area was going to light up as pictured and it did not. It does have an indicator light on the opposite side of the input port. The charger, though, worked like a charm.
","
This is a great looking charger. (I’d say it looks better in person than in picture.) Very modern and thin profile. It fits perfectly in my living room.I am happy with how easy it is to charge. I had a different brand before and that one is picky about the angle/position you put the phone. This one isn’t like that at all. Super easy and charges pretty fast.Note that the indicator light is always on though. If you want to put it in the bedroom and you can’t tolerate any light... then it’s not for you.
","
I just put my phone on before sleepWork as intended!Edit: After using it for some times i keep hearing a small high pitch electrical sound when working near it while not charging.Usually i don’t mind ,but when the room is quiet it get on my nerves.
","
Avoiding beating around the bush, I bought this charger because it was cheap. I was working on an idea to build a wireless charging shelf in my Land Rover, so I just wanted something cheap that I could mount into my project. After I bought it, though, it ended up on my bedside table waiting for the other parts to arrive. It looks so good and functions so well that I ordered ANOTHER one to go into the car. Both are now working perfectly!On a side note - I LOVE the charging indicator lights. They feel like the future.

 Very cute for my dew job and pink theme! It charges very nicely and fast
","
I love these so much I bought two more for my husband. I've purchased after market wireless chargers in the past, and they've ended up on the trash, these work great! We use them for our phones as well as our ear buds. So convenient, one on the desk, one on the night stand, one in the kitchen.
","
I bought one for myself and one for my mom. My mom absolutely loves hers and I like mine too. It charges even with a case! I gave it four stars because I have woken up the next morning and my phone didn’t charge. It can be picky on your phone placement which is a little frustrating but overall it’s a great charger
","
I love the look of this device.  It appears much more expensive than it costs.  It is super easy to use.  Works as described and I like the LEDs built in to tell you if it is charging, idle, or not passing enough to charge a device due to an obstruction.  Would buy again!
","
Coolest Wireless Charger ever!I was using a stand wireless charger bedside and at night in the dark, I would always have a hard time setting my iPhone on because the charger would move while trying to place it onNow I can just set my phone down with no issues!It’s slim, sleek, and blends into my black glass tabletop
","
Tozo has great products. Ii have also been buying headphones for other family members be and they have been very happy.
","
I really like the classy and glossy appearance of charging pad; definitely reminds you of the iPhone's clean appearance.  I also like the size and placement of the LEDs, so you can easily see if your device is charging; green in standby, blue when charging.  This pad works much better than others I have bought ion easily connecting to the device and staying connected throughout the charge.  I am very impressed with it for the price.
","
After looking at various wireless charger, I decided to purchase the TOZO wireless charger. This is my very first wireless charger and I am very happy with it. When the package first came, I was so surprise to see how sleek and compact the charger actually is. Despite its small size, it did not look cheap at all! I plugged the cable included into my old iPad adapter and place my phone on the charging pad and it charged right away. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this charger and I can't wait to keep using it.
","
This piano black wireless charger looks very nice and it works with my Samsung S9 and iPhone XR. I finally solved my problem of different charging cables. Now it doesn't matter what phone I am charging. Sweet!It even provides fast charging. I can also charge my Tozo wireless earbuds. The LED (blue/green) tells you when it is charging (blue) and done (green).The package includes a USB type C cord but it does not come with a A/C adapter. I use one of my fast charging adapter that came with my phone.
","
Works great with my Kyocera 5g phone even with a case on the phone.
","
This works as expected, but the audible tone when no phone is on it makes it somewhat annoying if you are near it.
","
This is the first one that I have found that will actually charge my phone with the phone case on. I have a thicker phone case with two credit cards in the holder and it charges fine!
","
Very easy to set up and use but charges my phone much slower than adapter and cable that came with the phone.
","
Never leave reviews, but I am very impressed with the thinness and how low-profile this wireless charger is! Just received the charger so I tried to charge my dad’s phone that has a leather wallet-like case on it just as a test and it works! I’ll update here if there’s any issues down the road, but very happy about this purchase :)
","
My only issue is I have bought 4 and 1 already quit working after a week ! So not happy about that.  The other 3 are fine at the moment
","
This looks great. I really liked it so I ordered another one.It charges little slow compared to other wireless chargers but for me that’s not a problem.
","
Received this product about a week ago. Arrived very quickly. The most elegant and beautiful design I have found of this type of product. Easy setup...works perfectly. I am currently using with my iPhone XS on a bedstead. I usually play music with a timer and set it on the TOZO Wireless Charger...music goes off after timer and iPhone is fully charged in the morning ready for another day. It takes up little space, thinnest design of this type of product I have seen and works as advertised...The safety features are great as well. Love this product and highly recommend it!!
","
Nice
","
The product looks great -very sleek and easy to use.  The only issue is that the charge powers extremely slow compared to some other chargers, but still good to have for easy charging without having to plug/unplug often.
","
Takes twice the amount of time when I try to charge my Samsung note 10+.I use my phone's genuine charging adapter for this. But it seems like we need to use a lower wattage adapter as written in the description.I prefer using my regular wired charger instead.
","
Easy to use
","
I mostly bought for the aesthetic appeal. I thought a mirrored charger would look cool on my bedside table however it is white not mirrored as it appears in the photo. It does work on my iphone but not my ipad.
","
I have purchased this twice. Very stylish and charges phone fast. I have one on my bedside table and one at my desk. I no longer need to use the plug in chargers.  Just set you phone on the disk and it charges
","
This wireless charger is easy to use and very good looking. When plugged in, the pad has green lights on 2 sides of the top surface. When a phone is set upon the charger, the lights change to blue to indicate charging has commenced. It can't get any easier. Just plug in the included USB-C cable or use one of your own.
","
I ordered this for my husband's Samsung S8 plus. We were a little skeptical about how it would work. He was tired of trying to open up his water proof case charging port every time he wanted to charge it. This charger works with the case on and it charges well (charging time and % is the same as the wired charger). It is very thin and indiscreet. All in all, it was a great purchase.
","
I had been looking for a charger that didn’t break the bank and still took care of my phone (iPhone SE 2nd generation) and this one was the best by far. I didn’t expect it to work this well but it amazed me on how fast it charges and how well it works with the other phones in my home.
","
This is so cool! Technology has come such a long way! I was in need of a new charger and saw my step dad had one of these and it worked so well! So I bought one! I do wish the chord was longer but that's ok! It looks so futuristic! So far so good!
","
I do not like that fact that its got its own cable built in.  The cable is not very long ..
","
I this as a Christmas gift and though I’ve only had it a couple of days, I am very impressed with the quality of this. Also, I have another brand of a wireless charger. This TOZO charger is really nice as the phone actually stays on the chatger and does not slip off. I would definitely get this again and recommend it
","
The charger is twice as thick as advertised.It is only 2.5 mm thick as shown in the product image at the edge, the center and feet are 5mm thick. I bought this specific size for a specific application, it is too large to fit my application.Beyond that its a small step up in appearance from any other basic wireless charging pad.
","
bought this as a gift for christmas. I worked fine for 2 months. then just would not work. Too late to return to amazon. Can't find where to contact for replacement?
","
Very thin and small. Doesn't clutter up the desk. I love that it works well with my phone and TOZO wireless earphones for wireless charging- cuts out the need for separate cords! I have been using it for a few weeks and haven't come across any issues yet.I've been using it with. the AC adapter that came with my iPhone and it works well.
","
II’ve the charger. Charges relatively fast. Works on any type of phone. Phone could have a thin case on it while charging. My otter box case I have to take the hard part off but can leave the rubber part on. Like the fact that it flashes green to let you know that it’s hooked up ready to charge but it turns Blue when phone is really charging.
","
This product is just like described. It’s aesthetically pleasing, too. It charges fast and it is very convenient. If you are anything like me, I like that you can just place your phone and easily charge as opposed to physically connecting your phone to a charger. I have one next to my bed so I can just lay it on the charger.
","
Very slow to charge but looks nice
","
I bought two of these, and liked it so much, I just bought two more. I love how the LED's go from green (not charging) to violet/blue when charging. Even when your phone is on the charger and fully charged it goes back to green. It did get a little warm with the case still on the phone, but not too bad, and it stops charging when full and cools down. They look awesome too. High recommendation.
","
This is a wonderful product that actually saved my favorite android tablet from being ruined.  I could no longer charge my Nexus for some reason using the charging port...tried several different cables to no success.  However with the TOZO wireless charger it can now be charged very well.  At first I was not sure how to use it because not a lot of instructions came with the charger but contacted the company for help and they were awesome!  The best consumer support I have experienced in a long time.  Thank you Shirley at TOZO
","
I like things that I don’t have to worry about. And this is one of them. I plug it in and set my phone on it. Boom. That’s it. Easy as pie. Charges as I sleep. Wake up with the phone fully charged.
","
I ordered my wireless charger 2 days ago, got it today. Like my headline says, it is definitely a must buy. I love it how it lets me know when the phone is charging because of the lights on the side. The charging is great. All you have to do is place the phone on the charger, and let the charger do the rest. This charger is worth the money.
","
I got the blue one with the glossy top. The indication LEDs on the top is evenly lit and not too bright for nightstand use but still visible in the daylight. The product description mentions micro-USB, but mine was USB C and came with a USB C cable, which was a pleasant surprise. Quality is better than expected for $13.
","
So, just received it, and it's my 1st wireless charger. On first sight the packaging is fantastic, nice sturdy box, secure package case. On to the product. Nice solid charger and slick looking. It's easy to use, just connect the usb charger, and your're done. I have a clear silicone case with hard black rubberized reinforcement around it, and I was able to charge my phone with it on. Over all impress with the look and quality of this Tozo product.
","
Easy to use, charges quicky. Really like the rose gold color
","
The nickel is to show how small and slick this charger is. It's very simple to hook up, (just plug it in), and the usb type c to usb adapter is a great addition to keep it versatile. The design is very slick and you can hardly notice it around the house. Amazing product TOZO!!!
","
Best purchase of 2021. I have an iPhone 8 that looses power easily. I’m on my phone constantly throughout the day for work and this is great for my desk. Super easy to use. I can set it down when I’m not using it to charge , no irritating cords
","
I needed a charger for work, and it’s my second time using it. I like it so far, doesn’t charge as fast as the original charger but it still does the job. You do have to place it correctly though, because I did catch it not charging a few times but when I repositioned, it charged well.  I’ll see how it goes
","
Love how compact it is for travel, very thin and has blue lights when charging and turns green when charged
","
This charger works great and is very sleek on my nightstand. Just a heads up - I got the matte black one and it doesn’t have the 2 lights on top. Just one small light in the front. It’s actually nicer for sleeping because it’s not too bright. Also the top is a grippy material, so my phone doesn’t slide off.
","
The product is super sleek and it requires no direction. It charges instantly, my phone has a thick case and a pop socket and I don’t even have to take it out. I just place my phone on top of it, and it charges automatically. For anyone that works in an office, this would make your life so much easier!
","
Its a nice wireless charger. The design is wonderful with the reflective surface and minimal lighting. Most other wireless chargers have bright flashing lights that never turn off. This charger does have consistent lighting, however its not bright at all so its convenient if you keep it next to your bed while sleeping. The one downside is how slow it charges. I charge my phone throughout the night so its not a problem for me but for others who want a faster charge it probably won't be the first choice. Overall, its good for the price and it does what is asked.
","
Overall very Nice. Chargers through case which I like a lot. Indicator light is annoying at night, solved that with piece of electrical tape.
","
I use this on my desk because I put my phone in the same place every time. It doesnt charge very quickly but it will charge my phone and airpods and detects non-chargable metals on it.
","
It is very thin and looks amazing on my desk.  The lighting is subtle and you don't have to fuss with it to get your phone to charge.  Would be a great gift and I highly recommend this charger.  (You will need your own charger brick though but if you're like me you should have a few in a drawer somewhere.)
","
Good to go. Product is as described.
","
It’s a really good product but if u bump ur phone if u don’t put it on the charger correctly it won’t charge a little annoying but nothing to bad
","
This charger works fine so far, but it doesn’t have the lights on top as described. It has a small LED light on the front of the charger which is unobtrusive. My unit is USB-C, not Micro USB, which is also different than described.
","
Just got today and started using.  Very easy to use, however I wish the instructions were a little more detailed as to what the indicator lights show.
","
Phone takes awhile to charge just like any other wireless charger. I like the different lights that go on and off to let me know I have a notification.
","
I thought this was going to be a great addition to my desk.  It took me a while to realize this charge is just incredibly slow.  Sadly, the return window has passed and I'm a bit bitter!  I'd keep looking if I were you
","
Il  that it works with all charger blocks including my 100wat lightning charger.
","
I really like this charger - works and looks great. I have bought 4 more for other rooms in my home and at work
","
I bought this to take to work and always have my phones charged. It is perfect, it truly keeps my phone charged all day. The only negative thing that I did find is that it has a light that is always plugged. For example its green it its just on and plugged with no phone on top, and then turn blue when i place my iPhone. This light would probably bother me if I use it next to my bed at night.Besides that, it is absolutely perfect and good looking.
","
Its perfect for when you are on the go. Its virtually unnoticeable in my messenger bag and it charges really fast for a wireless charger
","
Just as described it is incredibly thin. Charging does depend on the ac adapter that you use for it. It comes with a small cord so that was a small perk for me. Didn't break even though I put some weight on it so that was another good thing.
","
Worked great at first then stopped turning out. Contacted customer service and they were easy to work with and sent out a replacement immediately.
","
I’m in LOVE with this. It charges fast but obviously not as fast as the lightning charger. However, if you leave the phone for 2 hours, it charges up to around 10% I would say. It’s really worth the value. PLUS, I’ve been using it for a month now and it has not heat up or anything!!
","
I love how it shuts the charging off as soon as your phone is charged and if your battery drops while it's turned off it'll turn back on by itself and bump the battery back up to 100
","
Easy and straight forward.It does heat up a lot, it melted the back of my phone. The part where I have rhe little pocket for cards and such.
","
I have been avoiding wireless charging for quite sometime now but with how much time I spend on my desk I thought why not. One of the nicest looking wireless chargers Ive seen. Very sleek, uses USB C to connect to the wall, and the lights indicating charging are really good. Overall 5/5. For the price it is worth it.
","
I use this for my ear pods apple, just lie the case on them every night to charge works great.
","
This charger is gorgeous and sleek. I got mine in pink to match my personality and other Apple accessories. I had some trouble with the initial one I bought not functioning correctly but I reached out to the company and they were more than happy to replace it for me. Would definitely reccommend.
","
My third wireless charger.  First two also looked good and worked.  Until they stopped.  The Tozo W1 unit is heavier than the earlier purchases, looks even better (glad to choose the blue light) and it starts charging as soon as the phone hits it.  My guess is that the active area on the pad is larger.  Oh.  The price.  Best of the three.  I recommend it.
","
I guess it works fine, maybe wireless charging technology is not as good as I want it to be. I have two phones and they must be placed on the device with exact precision to get them to charge. It doesn't really save me time or ease. Plugging them in is easier and gives me more assurance my device will be charged.
","
I would like this more if it would charge with a case on . Also at times I notice it hasn't charged all night, so it doesn't always sync to charge properly.  So always double checking to make sure it's charging.Love the color and the style.***UPDATE **Company contacted me and is sending a new replacement. I will update after a week of use and see if what I had was just a faulty device. Working with customer service has been a pleasure.  They really seem to care about their products AND their customers.
","
It’s a beautiful, sleek product that couldn’t be simpler to use. Plug it in, lay your wireless charging capable device on it, done. The blue lights change to green while it’s charging, and once it’s finished they turn back to blue. I love the clean, simplistic look and operation of this device. For the price point, it can’t be beat.
","
Just got this but need to leave a review for the warranty. Works as expected so far. Kinda had a weird smell but hopefully that goes away.
","
My wife and I decided to get wireless earbuds and I opted for this charger at the same time. It is really convenient to drop our earbuds case on to charge at the end of the day... no opening the flap and maneuvering connections. It isn't as convenient for my phone because it can't charge through my case but it's easy enough to pop out and charge. It should charge my watch but I haven't had a chance to check yet.Finally, the aesthetic is great. It isn't too big and has a sleek look to it.
","
Purchased this item with the mindset that it would improve clutter.  First one came without plastic sheet on the glass.  Aesthetically, the charger looks good.  Glass top with 2 LED lights on each side comes on.  Green for when its ready to use, and blue for when charging.  Its compact and probably great for travel.  Ease of use is great as it's just plugging it in and its ready to use.  However, that's when my issues came up.  As this did not come with an AC adapter, I used the recommended adapter, 5V-2A I had lying around.  I set my phone (Galaxy S7 Edge) down and began charging.  However, the device and phone heated up to the point that it was hard to handle.  I replaced with a second item thinking it may be defective.  Second one came with plastic sheet on glass, which hopefully means it is brand new and unused.  Using the same phone and adapter again, both the device phone heated up.  I also tried using other adapters and had the same result.  Did not turn on fast wireless charging, no case, and only the original usb-c cable they provided.  Cannot recommend this product for use with the S7 Edge.  Maybe I am using incorrectly but will be returning the item again.
","
I bought this after the first wireless charge I bought was so bright I couldn't have it in the bedroom next to me at night.  This one is much less bright but still very easy to tell when it is charging vs not.Good product.  Good price.  No issues.
","
I've bought many wireless chargers and they either didn't charge last enough, would cause my phone to overheat or they stopped working after a short time. I really like this charger cause it has worked well and no overheating. I also love the lights on the top of it showing my charge level. Great pad, and really thin also.
","
Love this charger! Was looking for something wireless but good quality because i am the destroyer of cords! Fake apple cords are just a no for any long term use and i was by a new Apple brand one every month. This thing worked like a charm. I have a leather LV case on my phone and was afraid I’d had to take it off at night. Nope. Works just fine
","
Very sleek looking. Thin - great for traveling. The LEDs are cool too, and effective. Only complaint, and it's minor, is the the LEDs never turn off - they're not going to keep you up at night, but the green lights are on constantly - indicating it's ready to start charging a device.
","
I loved this charger at first it is super sleek and flat it works perfect for a nightstand. At first it charged my phone super quickly, but then I started to wake up and my phone would only be charged half way and then not at all. I was super disappointed since it worked so well at first. I am not sure if it is because I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max but it says in the description it should work for that phone. Overall disappointed about this wireless charger.
","
I like how it looks, looks so well designed, not ugly at all. It doesn't charge very fast, but it is expected on wireless charging. I have been using it next to my bed before I go to bed, so it charges without interruption. I hope to get another one in time. It is also easy wipe for maintenance.
","
Very easy to setup and use.  It is more suited for a permanent to semi-permanent setup as the charger only comes with a usb cord and not an ac adapter.  I wouldn’t use the charger for travel even with the slim design is still easier just to travel with a cord, and the charging speed is faster with a cord vs the Qi charging.  The slim and minimalist design though makes it attractive in the home or office setting.  The charger is also very quiet and the charging indicator lights are useful and stylish.
","
I couldn't tell from the reviews or from the product information, but after testing it, it is a wireless fast charger.  All of my other chargers only do wireless on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra.  This one finally gets the job done and is smaller than all of my other ones.
","
This device fits nicely on my desk so that I don't have to fudge with cables.  Phone, tablet, and more can be supported.  Is powered by a QC3.0 USB port.  Not sure I will travel with it as its just easier to carry less and plug in with a cable I would have with my USB battery or power plug, but if you did, its very thin and would easily slide in nearly any pocket.  Working great as I havent had any day with a charge that dropped below 50% as a result.
","
Not so easy to use in the car but when I have it plugged in at home it's amazing in that the charge time from empty to full seams at least twice faster than the conventional charge cord maybe meven quicker than that I didn't actually put a clock on it but it is very fast.
","
Super lightweight, but powerful! Great size for traveling and easy to use! I love the color and sleek looks as well! Definitely, would buy again!!
","
Only works on one phone in our house.  My phone is only 2 years old and the charger will not work on it.
","
Unfortunately it's not compatible for fast charging with my Samsung 21 Ultra. But it charges other items at normal speed just not ""fast"".
","
I just got it in the mail today! So far it has been great! Very sleek and easy to use. My friend recommended it to me and she loves it. My phone case is too think so I have to take it off to charge but it’s really no hassle at all and would probably work if I had a slimmer case. Overall very satisfied.

 I have been using this great product, now, for a couple weeks. The best place to use it is where ever you lay your phone while you sleep, by habit. You get to keep your habit and the phone is fully charged when you are ready to start the new day. Thank you, TOZO, for a great and practical product.
","
This is the first wireless charger I have ever used, so take it for whatever it is worth.  My Samsung S8 works well, however it gets really hot (front and back) while charging.  Is this normal???  I do like the slim low profile of the charger and the LED's on each side.  I don't think you can go wrong with this charger especially for the price.
","
Doesn’t charge very fast
","
I haven’t really used it yet that much but sondar I love it. The design it’s very nice. It charged my phone whithout problems and I was so happy I was able to charge my todo headphones too. Which by the way I looove too. So overall I have a faith in this brand
","
This is my first wireless charger and I absolutely LOVE it. It works for my iPhone and for my Tozo wireless headphones. It charges quickly, and is a small enough profile that it is easy to take anywhere. I highly recommend it for its quality, and also for it's reasonable price.
","
I tried another brand charger and it would not charge wirelessly with a Rokform iPhone 12 Max Pro Case.  I was very disappointment and found this case and thought I would give it a try.  Once lined up with the wireless charger my phone IMMEDIATELY begin charging.  This is a great wireless charger for those with thicker iphone cases.
","
great
","
It’s so annoying. I don’t know if it’s cause I have a magnet but this is my experience.
","
After a couple weeks it still works great, a convient charger for my desk.
","
I actually love it but it didn't work on my husband's Otterbox case. It's great if you don't have a heavy duty case. I recommend it highly
","
Small and easily portable. Has a good design and feels well made overall. Happy with the first impression. Phone begins charging as soon as it’s placed
","
The first one intermittently wouldn't charge (maybe overheated). Return and ordered another one because I liked the feel of the product and the ease of charging. Very happy so far.
","
My cell wont accept cables i guess its damaged in the charging port so i use this ...no problem whatsoever , but it does charg a bit slower than when i used my cable
","
I got this for my daughter she has an iPhone 13 and she loves it. It's thin and doesn't take up a lot of space
","

 The charger looks great as expected.  Working good  out of the box.  It comes with USB type-c cable, which is a plus.  I like arc-shaped LED indicators on surface change color when in charging mode. Charger looks elegant and feels solid.  Packing is well built and looks like high end product category.  Hopefully, it reliable and will  last as it's looked.  It does not come with AC adapter as stated.
","
The thinnest and slickest charger yet! I particularly like the blue light while charging and the green light when it's done! Love this unit!The PROBLEM is, there are no instructions with this unit, and the ""sweet spot"" for a Samsung S9+ must be VERY small, since it is difficult to positiln the phone where it does not flash alternating blue and green. CONSIDERING RETURNING THIS ITEM.
","
Now that I have an updated phone, I love being able to use this charger and just set my phone down on it to charge - no attaching cords!  So convenient so I can just pick it up and use it without yanking on a cord!

 This is a very well made and stable magnet charger. As you can see on the video, it is responsive and works as described. Why would you spend so much of your hard-earned money on the Apple charger when you can get a charger that works just as well for a fraction of Apple's price?
","
This is my third QI charger. The other two Qi Chargers that I have are Samsung. I thought I would try this new flat charger to see how it works. I am pleasantly pleased. Not only by the appearance but same ability to charge my phone quickly. Also I am pleased that all you have to do is lay the phone on the charging plate and it automatically starts. With the Samsung upright Qi Chargers, you have make sure that it is positioned properly. Good product
","
Works well you just have to make sure it’s centered or else it will not charge.
","
Haven’t had too much time to review but my first thoughts are it looks nice and charges my phone so far. Hopefully it last and keeps working
","
It’s great I bought it on my trip and was easy to slide out for use. Charging power is great for my iPhone. I’ve had no problems. Me and at least  5 coworkers have this from black to my favorite rose gold color. It’s a great birthday gift.
","
The small form factor is a great plus, it looks very sleek and stylish.But functionally, it's a very low voltage and the basic plug in cable will charge the phone faster, there are better wireless options that are only slightly more expensive.
","
Great charging pad!  Very thin and has a green led indicator so you know when power is on.Bought it to charge my TOZO Earbuds,  but I found out it also charges my iPhone X and iPhone 7.Easy and very convenient,  just place the wireless charging item on the pad and your charging light should turn on.
","
I bought one for my husband and I and we were skeptical because of how cheap they are but you guys they work!! And they’re thin but heavy - meaning they don’t feel cheap. Look nice on a nightstand.
","
The product is great, but my purpose to submit review is the customer service. Had a slight issue which was mainly my fault, but customer service went out of their way to ensure I was promptly taken care of. For that reason, I will buy a few more as gifts. 5 stars from me :-)
","
Purchased this charger about a month ago.  Was pleasantly surprised at its appearance and quality, given the price.  It works quite well on my iPhone X.  The LEDs on the charger are not a problem for leaving it next to the bed during sleep, as they are fairly dim and act as a sort of night light.  When pacing the phone on the charger, good feedback is given as it tends to center itself magnetically on the charger.  I use a fairly thin silicone case which does not block the function of the charger.  Well-made and functioning charger.
","
I just got a new iPhone 11 and was intrigued with the wireless charging. After a lot of comparisons and research, I opted for the TOZO wireless charger. No longer will I fumble with a tiny plug in the dark. This charger has a comfortable glow to locate it in my darkened bedroom. It changes from green to blue when I place my iPhone on it and unlike others, I do not need to be precise in placement. So far it’s a good product and I’ll recommend it to anyone seeking convenience.

This thing is AMAZING LOVE !
","
I really like how this charger cleaned up my kitchen counter with a sleek and simple disk.  Now when I go to make dinner, I can just drop my phone the charger to revive my battery after a long day.  I typically would avoid plugging it in due to how often I have to keep picking it up and unplugging it each time I get pinged throughout the evening.
","
Working great for our new ear buds but just wish we could charge two at once. It seems big enough but cannot charge both pairs at the same time.
","
As soon as i opened it up and plugged it in the cord started smoking. I unplugged it and saw that it had some burn marks on it and i could smell smoke very strongly. The pad itself works fine but im not happy that the cord couldve caught on fire had i not immediately noticed the smoke.
","
This is an OK charger. As some reviewers have said it is an overnight charger, it takes some time to charge your phone.It looks great, I got white and gold version and it does look really nice.The only concern I have is that the lights on each side of the pad do not turn off EVER...As long as your charging pad is plugged in ( which it would be all the time for me, because I have it on my night stand so I can charge overnight) the lights do not turn off at all. I find them to be bright, especially at night if you are not charging you pone the lights work like a night light. I don't like it at all. Very annoying.
","
This is a nice wireless charging pad - better than the Samsung one I used before. It only can only put out what you put into it, so plug it into a factory AC adapter from your phone for best results. Comes with a USB-C cable and charging base. Basically plug-and-play. Green lights when powered up, blue when charging.
","
The build quality is fantastic, feels like it has some good quality materials. It charges perfectly. I love the different styles and colors. It's super thin so it's easy to travel with. I use it to charge my Corsair wireless mouse, and also my phone. Also, the fast charge feature is a great bonus. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.
","
Pros:- simple- Solid and feels like a quality wireless charger.Cons:- Just a little slow when charging the phone (If you are in a hurry a physical charger is better than a wireless one)- Your phone can be bumped off the charger- You will need to get a plug for the cable to plug into in order for it to work when you purchase one.
","
** EDIT Update - this company went above and beyond! They reached out and got me a replacement straight away and made sure to make amends. %* service. New charger charges fast and looks great. The black looks cooler than the gold one.First review: It takes a little moving around to get it in the right spot to charge. It looks good although the charging light is too bright at night to sleep next to but you can orientate the phone slightly to cover them. Sadly, the whole thing stopped working after just days. Disappointed.
","
Like the low sleek design, but my case is too thick so I can't charge my phone. The positive is my wife likes it and my son ordered on and likes it.
","
I bought this since I couldn't take having a bunch of wires on my desk. It fits perfectly on my desktop riser and charges well. I am also able to charge my phone with the pop socket on which is great. Great quality and aesthetically pleasing. Will definitely be using this company in the future.
","
I like the size and design of the product, and would recommend it. However, although it charges quickly, it does not hold a charge the way a regular power cord does. If you're in a bind and need a quick charge, this product works for you - but if you need your phone battery to last a long time then I would use a regular power cord.
","
This thing is awesome! It FAST charges my note10+Clean glass finishCool info lights to show;Charging, charged and ""error""(it stops powering when you put anything other than a wireless chargable phone on it.It wont over charge phone because it cuts off power once fully chargedComes with a type c to USB cable, but im using the type c to type c, fast charge cable my phone came with.
","
Product is packaged well, unlike many things I bought China-made that are just thrown in zip-lock bags then in a box. I thought this plate had those Parenthesis-shaped charging lights on top, even the manual pointed to them as the charging indicator. But the one I received was nothing like that. It has a Pin-hole light on the side which is easily hidden out of sight and difficult to see unless your in a dark room. It charges my Galaxy Note 8 with a case on it so it does the job. Also, descriptions from other purchasers say it uses a micro USB plug, totally wrong, this uses a type C connector. Unless I clearly received a totally different product than what I was supposed to get this turned out to be something I did not expect from Tozo.
","
This product frustrates me because I will set my phone on it, the charging sound chimes and when I wake up or come back for it I will find it uncharged and warm to touch. Now I double check before sleep or walking away that it’s charging but I shouldn’t have to. I also wish it didn’t put out any light. It’s green when ready to charge and blue when charging and I’m aware of it at night. Other that those complaints, it looks nice and it charges well when it wants
","
I ordered the wireless charger to go along with my wireless earbuds. The charger is very simple to use, just plug and play. The charging time is pretty fast on most of my devises. I do take it with me to work everyday and use it there as well. It does travel very well. I’d definitely recommend this for anyone who needs to charge anything!!!
","
This is a pretty good product for the price I’ve had pricier items and they don’t work as well the charge takes longer this is pretty good and pretty quick it seems to connect with most devices I noticed it doesn’t connect with many of the older ones but it is a good product
","
It gets a little warm but not hot 🤓 It works well. The magnetic’s are not to strong. It is a quality product & like the USB A & C connection.
","
It was really good over all but the lights were really bright to sleep with and it’s a little bit particular about where on the pad you place your device.
","
I’ve been looking for a wireless charger for a while now and it seemed like anything worth my time was also quite expensive. That is until I found this one. I’ve only had it over night now but I love it so far! It has a simple and clean design and the lights that glow on it are easily covered by the phone for overnight charging (no bright lights to keep you awake). Not to mention, the price is really unbeatable! Looking forward to many more days of wireless charging!
","
Have only had this for one day, so far so good. Looks great, works well, hard to beat for the price. My phone stays cool while charging, even with my thin case on it, seems to charge as quickly as being plugged in.If I could change one thing, I'd prefer to have the lights on the top turn off after a certain amount of time. They're not terribly bright, however bright enough that at night I have to position my phone a certain way to cover the lights and keep the room dark. Otherwise, highly recommend.
","
This is my first true wireless charger. Taking it out of the packaging I immediately noticed the nice weight of the charger. Feels very sturdy and well made. All I had to do was plug it in and I was good to go. It charges my dear us and phone flawlessly and once I used my fast charging power brick, it was charging my phone quickly. Overall, I could not ask for more .
","
I don't know if mine is faulty or what, but this thing barely charges at all let alone charge fast. I have several adapters including a samsung fast charge adapter. Yet it still took almost 3 hours to charge my 41% battery phone. It's simply not worth it. Also I could not use this with my spigen case on.
","
At the end of the day I drop my phone onto the disk.  I am not careful about lining it up.The little light on the disk changes from green to blue.When I come back in the morning, the light is green, and my phone is charged.What's not to love?
","
Looks great and works really well so far. I've been using it for about a month now.Charges well even through my otterbox defender case. I don't find myself needing to reposition my phone to make it charge like I do with other wireless charges I've used.
","
Charging has never been so much fun and easy! It truly makes a difference just placing the AirPod case on Tozo’s Wireless Charger and moving on to the next thing. The neon color on the black contrast looks so modern and futuristic. This is the most beautiful wireless charger design I have seen.
","
I got one of these wireless chargers for my new headphones and my son saw it. He tried it on his phone and it worked great. He used mine until he was able to order his own. He loves it.
","
I have been more than very satisfied with every product I’ve tried from Tozo. I have several of their wireless earbuds - easy to connect and use- and now several of their chargers for wireless devices. I feel each one has been both a great value for the money spent and great product design with good performance.
","
I bought it for my office so I could charge my phone and works great to hide from people walk up or into the office.
","
I like the look and small foot print of the item. Now we will see how long it last. Will have to update later after using it for awhile.
","
When I first saw this charger I thought this thing looks premium.  I wanted a wireless charger for my wife's Iphone 12 and this charger is perfect.  It looks premium, works like it should, & doesn't get hot.  I've had other cheap plastic wireless chargers that didn't work the greatest, this charger works great.
","
I love this charger. Not only does it function amazingly (charges faster than some other wireless chargers I've used in the past), but it looks the most sleek. I just love the look, how smooth and simple it is. It's perfect in appearance, without any logo or anything except for the black charging surface. I highly recommend! They also have fantastic customer service, reaching out to you once you register your product for a free one year warranty!! Definitely going to buy more products from this company if I need more.
","
This charger is fine, you get what you pay for. It’s very finicky, and I often have to maneuver my phone around multiple times for it to recharge fully. Although it does charge my phone quickly when it is working. I have a brand new iPhone X so I doubt it’s my phones problem. It also has no problem charging on other people’s wireless charging pads.
","
Charging is great for the earbuds, but charge is slow when trying yo charge my Samsung phone
","
I got my charger in a couple of days ago and so far it’s been great. I like how it’s slim, it doesn’t take up a lot of room on my night stand, but most of all I like how it’s not that bright when charging. There are two lights on the top of the charger and it’s green when not charging and blue when charging. My previous charger had lights all around that if I didn’t put it on the floor so it was out of my sight I wouldn’t sleep well.
","
Unlike the Apple Magsafe charger, the Tozo W6 will not operate properly if you want to place the charger between a magnetic car mount and your phone. No indication this could not be done, so I learned the hard way and it's going back. Other than that, it appears to be a decent charging puck. There's a reason why the Apple products are more expensive; because they work.
","
I really like the slim design of the charger and it’s really easy to use. It seems like it might be a little slower to charge.
","
Good price. Charges quickly with a wireless charger. Light is bright but when the phone is charging it is mostly covered. Comes with a 1 year warranty. I like the look of this charger compared to other wireless chargers that I bought. I did buy 5 of these and one stopped working after 2 months but the customer service is awesome and they are replacing it!
","
Although it works, overall, not happy.  Very light weight, slides around on counter.  Had to use double sided tape to secure to counter  Must position phone in exact spot to charge.  Does not easily charge thru case.  Honestly. wont be using it much.  Would not recommend.***FOLLOW UP***The company did reach out to me about a replacement with an updated charger.  Although its an improvement, its NOT a big one.  I do appreciate the EXCELLENT customer service, but the replacement item is not much better.  Sorry, still would not recommend
","
So easy to use. I keep it in the kitchen and just set my phone on it each time I'm in there to keep my battery up. It's pretty enough to look nice sitting there . So cool. Definitely  recommend!
","
Works great. I have an a10e and bought qi adapter to charge wirelessly. The charger is well made and works through my phone case. I have seen that some qi chargers don't work well with a case on but this does. Well worth it. I just purchased another and the magnetic charger for the car. Good stuff
","
I just received this product, and really liked both the width and the thinness. Compared to the previous Tozo wireless charger I bought, this one is definitely superior in every way. I managed to charge my wireless earbuds quite quickly. I also really like the rubber pads on the bottom to keep it still without adding too much height. Another great Tozo product that I highly recommend.
","
I bought the Tozo wireless ear buds and really like those. I'm an audio book addict so I can wear down the battery life of ear buds quickly.  This charger is perfect to recharge them, fast. I just lay the charger and ear buds on top. Voila! Quick recharge. I'm not sure that I can recharge my iPhone 8 using this-- and maybe I need an additional accessory. No worries, it's really my ear buds that I want to quickly recharge. Happy with the price and results.
","
I have been using this charger for over a year, with no issues, to charge my Tozo wireless earbuds.Starting recently, it gets extremely hot. If I had not noticed in time, the earbuds likely would have been damaged. Moved the charger to a different USB adapter plug with the same results.
","
Great power supply easy to assemble
","
This charger is so nice looking and easy to use. It takes a long time to charge compared to the charger that came with my iPhone but it’s fine.Update ten days later: completely stopped working
","
This is a very nice looking low-profile charger.  I ordered 3 and placed them throughout my home for easy access.  It is nice to have a fully charged phone where ever you are at.  It is small and can be packed with minimal space requirements as well.  Finally, it is quite nice looking!!
","
It’s thin, charges perfectly and has an incredible design!
","
Works fine just bright at night. Got a different one for the bedroom with a smaller light. We use this one at our desk instead.
","
When we received the charger, it was fine. Charging speed was slow but it worked. Now conveniently its been a month and just past the return window, and the charger has completely stopped working. Just complete garbage experience. Unless we got a defective one, save yourself the stress.. But nothing about this charger was amazing.
","
I broke my charging port and this has been my solution to buying a new phone. It seems to work with friends phone and my own phone. Works great 👍
","
I love this charger.  I had a different brand for a while and it stopped working so I decided to try something new. This charger is excellent. it arrived with a small scratch but it still works just fine and I love the fact that it's so thin. I will definitely recommend this product
","
Sleek, thin design with subtle light accents to indicate when it is ready to charge and when it is charging your device.It charges at a slower rate than your traditional cord but fast enough to increase battery life while streaming on your device.
","
The first night I had the charger, it didn't charge my phone to a full charge even though it was on all night. I wasn't sure why, but then I thought about taking my case off. I have a Symmetry Otterbox case on, and I have never had any trouble with a charger like this before with my case on. The next night, I tried it without my case on and it charged it perfectly fine. The other issue I have with it is the fact that it needs its specific usb cord to charge. I have another charger like this that takes an iphone charger usb. Other than those two things, I love the charger. It is extremely easy to pack away.
","
Purchased the wireless charger with earbuds for an easier charge capability. Plugged in the charger & the earbuds immediately started charging. Also charged my Samsug S7 just by setting on charger. The charger is thin and has a green glow when plugged in; then turns blue when devise is placed & charging.  I will probably get another charger for my other office.
","
I love that I can sit my wireless earbuds on top of charger and know they will be ready for use. I enjoy I don’t have to replace cord anymore:)
","
This is a good purchase if your having trouble pluging your charger into your phone. Other than that I don't see the purpose because it still has to be plugged into the wall in order to work.I only purchased this item because it was recommended by Amazon to go with the Sound Angel speaker shown in the photo for wireless charging.This does not charge the speaker at all but it does charge my phone.
","
I purchased the Tozo W6 charger to charge my wireless Tozo headphones. The charger is very small making it easy to carry around with you. It has a c port that you have to attach the included usb end to. That is the only issue that I had because the usb attachment was hard to attach.
","
You have to set the phone on it, in just the right angle, but so far it had been working good. (1week in)
","
This is a much more convenient way to charge my phone. It’s a really cool design, and the LED lights make it easy to see by my bed at night. If wires are a pain, or if your lightning cable no longer works.... this is the way to go. A GREAT BUY!!
","
Works great. Love the pink color. I like how the light is green and when you charge your phone the light turns blue.
","
Love the design. The indicator lights are very clear but unobtrusive.
","
Slim charger.  When it’s charging it turns blue and when it’s not it’s a yellow light on the charger.  Very convenient for
","
Product was very nicely packaged, easy to set up and use.  Worked exactly as described.  I like it so much, that I immediately bought another one for my brother.  This is an attractive item to set on the table next to my favorite chair.  I just set my phone on the pad and it charges.  I can grab the phone and go knowing that it has been charged.  The slim profile makes it so that you don't know the phone is setting on anything other than the table.
","
I have been using this for my phone and accessories for about 2-3 months now. This is a solid wireless charger.  Construction is great.  Looks awesome! I would recommend to a friend.
","
This is my second Tozo charger. It is really small as seen it the picture. I believe it is designed with the magnet to stick to the Iphone 12. Currently we have a XR that isn’t magnetic but works great especially since it is wireless and doesn’t take uo much space on the counter. Another great TOZO product!
","
Great charger in all ways. One thing I noticed is if your phone is off center it may not charge.  Doesn't have to be perfectly centered but don't go to bed drunk and be too far off center.  😁
","
This is a sleek and beautifully designed wireless charger. I took it out out of the box, plugged the cable into a charging block, and my phone (iPhone X) started charging immediately. My wife loved the look of it so much that she wants one, too. Great product, no issues here!
","
I only just got this wireless charger today but I already love it! The fact the it will charge my cell phone through its case with a popsocket on it is awesome!! I actually bought it to charge wireless ear buds but will also use it with my phone now!
","
Nice little charger works well. USB-C connection works well with my charging block. Only negative as mentioned in orhher post is that the magnet is weak. Doesn’t hold tight through my Apple 12 case. With case off it’s much stronger but realistically I rarely have it out of the case. Good product, I recommend it.
","
Does this work? Yes. Will it take over an hour to charge your phone halfway? Yes.It’s pretty convenient in theory and it does work but it is sooooo slow to charge. And it’s not always super accurate at picking up your device when you place it on the center. For the price it’s fine, but it’s probably worth it to spend more on one that actually charges quickly.
","
My first review is below. Because of it, the company contacted me, said my charger may be defective, and sent me a new one for free - including shipping. it works fine and I appreciate the good service recovery of this company.Very slow charging compared to standard cord. Good on a desk for topping off.
","
Won't fast charge S20 Ultra, phone says not compatible. Other than that, seems fine.
","
Good quality.The one at work works relentlessly and for several months now, so I gotone for myself.If you are debating if you want one, I would get it.
","
I love Tozo products, I use mine to charge my pixel phone while working. It is so much better than plugging in and unplugging a phone to a charger. I can easily just set the phone down and I'm the wireless charger works it's magic. This is the 5th or 6th Tozo item I have bought and it won't be the last
","
The charger I received was defective and I had already thrown the box away, however the customer service was excellent and offered to send me a replacement!
","
After communicating with the company regarding the defective charger, they sent me a new charger. This one works great, exactly as promised! I love the convenience of setting my phone down, and it starts charging, no wires to plug or unplug!! I now have one for my bedroom and one for my kitchen
","
A great choice.  I like the size...it is a very small wireless charger and is round in shape.  I use it for my phone and Bluetooth headphones.  I love that it preserves the connector of your devices...no need to physically plug and unplug every single day.  Just simply lay your device over the charger.
","
Awesome buy. Light weight and easy to use.  Works well with all my Galaxy products: phone, smart watch, earbuds live
","
This Incredibly thin base offers the fastest quick charge I’ve seen so far. The color changing lights on the charging surface let you know if it’s charging or finished. Very sleek and stylish looking addition too my home. I bought a second one for upstairs.
","
So far it's working great. Only have used it once but it's small and takes less space than the precious wireless charger i had.
","
I've had issues with wireless charging pads but this one has been perfect, straight out of the box!  Plugged it in and it was ready to go!  There is a green light around the edges to let you know that it is ready.  When you lay your phone down, the light ring turns blue to let you know it is charging (along with your phone responding with a charging icon). This could not be easier!  Will purchase more for the family! You won't regret this purchase!
","
Genuinely nice charger. Works well and is very slim!
","
This works perfectly. It doesn’t take too much space up on my nightstand. The wireless charger I had previous to this one had a light that went all the way around the device and lit up my bedroom all night. This one only had two smaller “light bars” on each side. I can easily place my phone on it at night so that the phone covers the lights and my room is still dark. It has a very sleek, clean looking design and I love the colors of it.
","
I bought this back in February for my Galaxy s21 and had no issues until now. My phone keeps receiving alerts that fast wireless charger is not compatible with my phone. That was the selling point for this brand and it no longer works. There is also no quick and easy contact method to get ahold of the company for troubleshooting.
","
I had been shopping for a wireless charger for my new iPhone 11 Pro since I purchased it last fall.  This one caught my eye with its sleek look and perfect size.  It arrived in a very nice package and was ready to use in minutes.  Its beautiful and very functional.  I use it to change my new AirPods too.  It starts charging immediately and notifies you when any non-chargeable object comes in contact with it.  I’ve recommended it to my friends and family.
","
It is easy to use and does what it supposed to do. The magnetic function is a little bit weak than I expected. Other than that, it's a good charger.
","
Liked the size and ease of use. Returned it because it will not charge IPhone 14
","
I like that the charger has a small status light on the edge of the pad. The previous charging pad had indicators on the top, so sometimes it’s difficult to see that the phone is no longer being charged. USB-C is a plus on this device, as that’s where the industry is heading, so it’s a bit future proof. Sure do like my charger!!
","
The only thing is I can’t charge my phone with my pop socket on
","
I like this product because even with my phone case on, the Tozo device is still able to charge the phone.  In addition to my phone case, I also have my work ID badge attached to the back of the phone.  With all these obstacles, Tozo is still able to charge the phone.  I'm impressed!
","
Great product! Slim, lightweight, and easy to use. Even works with a popsocket and a case on my phone, which no other charge pad I’ve had has been able to do.  Also, it’s a sleek design, and the LED lights are cool too.  Overall best charging pad I’ve come across and I’d highly recommended getting it!
","
This is a nice slim lightweight charger.  Works great, wish I would have purchased it long ago.  Material and quality appears to be good, it will be nice not having to plug our devices in all the time.  Works great with all out Apple devices.Update:  Liked this charger so much I just bought another one for my office!
","
I love the design of this and for the price it's simply a great deal. I'm so happy I went with this one. In fact, I just ordered 2 more now that I've seen it first hand. Lastly, don't listen to the BS about it not charging with a case on. I have a rubber/silicon Apple case and it charges great through it.
","
This charger has to be the most aesthetically pleasing design. It is so thin and the gold rims make it look like it costs a lot more money than it was. I would say the charging is fast, not super fast but I leave my phone charging over night so it's never been an issue for me. The light turns blue when a device is being charged and goes back to green when not in use. I would definitely recommend this charger as it's functional, and looks great on any nightstand!
","
This charger looks and functions perfectly. The lights are just bright enough to be visible in the dark but not light up the room in the dark. Charging seems to be quick (using a QuickCharge 3.0 charger) and I’ve had no problems with my phone overheating.The only “issue” I have is that the USB-C connector on the provided cable is slightly thicker than the charger itself, which can cause the phone to not lie perfectly flat on the face of the charger. This is incredibly minor though!
","
Beautiful item. Super thin. The simple LEDs let you know when your device is charging (Blue) and fully charged (Green). One caveat: When nothing is on the device, the green LEDs are lit, wasting power, so you have to unplug.
","
I bought it for my husband and he really likes it. No complaints.
","
Tried it with every phone in the house. Case and no case. Does not charge.
","
Just got my charger and so far it works really well.  Ive had the Tozo ear buds and they are fantastic and upgraded to the next ones out and saw tje charger.  It is very slim and light weight and easy to use.  So far I’m very happy with  it .  I’m able to charge my iphone and ear buds on it.
","
First time using a charger like this so I was kinda of clueless but the instructions were super helpful and easy to read! I bought this item as a bundle with another product and I am so glad I did it works with more than just that product! I'm not the most techy person but I'm very happy with this purchase!
","
Pros:• it looks sleek and sits comfortably on any flat surfaceCons:• it charges at such a slow rate that you’d have to leave your device on the charger overnight to maybe get 50% charge• the device needs to be specifically set in the right position to even charge, which is not guaranteed as it sometimes shows it has begun charging then stops and the device needs to be adjusted again• I would not feel comfortable placing this device in a travel bag, as I feel it would either break or crackOverall, if you want a fancy looking paperweight that will occasionally charge your phone then this might be for you. But if you need an actual charger I would rather fuss with a cable or invest in a better charger.* use solely with an iPhone 11
","
This charging disk works very well with the TOZO T12 ese plugs battery pack and all wireless capable cellphones. Cannot go wrong with the good price. By now I have probably purchased 3 or more. Good product, very satisfied with it. The best cup holder, ever. Just kidding about the cup holder
","
It charges fast and is easy to use
","
Charging time is not bad. It's good to carry around. It's easy to use.
","
The size and slimness of this device is very nice. Fits on the nightstand without a problem and the grip on then bottom prevents me from accidentally pushing it off. It charges just as fast as being plugged in and it’s very nice to just be able to place and pick up a phone without having to unplug it or plug it in.
","
This is a great FAST wireless charging system that will charge anything that is compatible with wireless charging.  Ultra thin and sleek design  this can go anywhere with you. In your car purse or any bag for convenient use at any time any place. It's non-slip pads keep it stable and secure.  Well worth the money and at this price two is better than one.
","
I have 3 or 4 of these quick charger disks around my house so there is always one nearby.  Just make sure you have a 110v convertor that can do 9v if you want a quick charge on your phone. Most only produce 5 volts.  This one has a higher quality feel to it do due the aluminum face.
","
Takes wayyyy too long to charge and sensor is not that great. If you finally get it to the charging mode after moving it around a few times it can disconnect if you get a call/text and the phone vibrates. I was looking for more of a cordless approach to charging but this ain’t it
","
I appreciate how compact this charger is. It’s so sleek and looks neat to not have a cord tangling up with my phone. I got it in light blue and it’s really pretty. Charges quickly enough. Doesn’t take up much space and it inexpensive.
","
This is an improved version from W1 that 2mm thinner and 10mm smaller. It makes carrying around even more convenient. The LED indicator lights also reduced in size for sleep-friendly. It supports fast charging when used with compatible charger. It also charges faster than other plastic made chargers. Over all this is another quality product from Tozo that you can trust.
","
I love how easy it was to set up and use. It worked perfect with my iPhone 11 and AirPods Version 2. They both also had cases and they both worked with the cases on. The LEDs allow us to know when it’s charging and it’s so cute and tiny so it’s perfect for when you want to take it on the go.
","
The first TOZO wireless charger I purchased did not work with my IPhone 12 Pro Max and I submitted a rather scathing review.  Since then TOZO has replaced the charger and it works beautifully with my IPhone 12.  I can only surmise that I originally received a defective charger as this one is great.
","
Very convenient to use. Does charge a little slower, but it charges and the lights help to let you know when it's charging.
","
I use a removable pop-socket on the back of my phone, that makes it a little difficult to use most wireless charging pads, it's hard to get the phone lined up on the sweet spot  This pad works much better.  I don't need to wiggle and reposition my phone.  I don't love the always on light but its fine.
","
The charger worked as stated, but is very sensitive to where you place an leave your phone on pad. Woke up some morning’s to find my iPhone was not fully charged. Other than this iPhone does get a quick charge.
","
The product design is neat and clean. I like the Led lights. You cannot expect wireless fast charging as fast as wired fast chargers. But for $12 it is worth the price.
","
This is our first experience with a wireless charger. Thus far, it has worked quite well. The only thing to keep in mind is if you have a magnet or something metal on the back of your phone, it will blink green and not work. Took me a bit to figure that out/remember that we had that magnet in there. Otherwise, it’s great!
","
It works as it should
","
Look this thing is solid and work great.  Has a strong magnet that automagically centers the charging pad and I love it!  It is just as well built as the alternatives IF NOT BETTER!  You won't go wrong with this purchase AND IT COMES WITH AN ADAPTER!! WIN WIN WIN!
","
Good product. Wish the indicator light was a complete circle so it can be easily seen. Depending on how you place the phone, the indicator can get blocked you don’t really get to see if it is charging or not placed properly.
","
It does charge nicely it’s so thin and sleek and modern I love the colors the design and most of all I’m bad with regular chargers they break on me and this is so easy to use and will not break on me which saves me a lot of money
","
It does not fast charge but does charge my phone 100%.
","
I love how modern this looked and easy to wipe clean.  The charging was a little slower than if I were to plug my iPhone or wireless earbuds directly with a normal USB cable.  Sometimes I'd have to unplug and replug the USB-C cable for the charger to reset.  Unfortunately it died about 9 months with limited use so I had to order another wireless charger.
","
I bought this charger for our TOZO Earbuds. And I have used it for other devices. It charges quickly and I never have to worry about the charging plate or the devices getting hot. One of my best purchases, for myself and as gifts.
","
I’m trying to get my phone yo charge with this but still trying earbuds no problem.
","
I’m so impressed with this charger. It lights up on the front side so you know your phone is charging. I use mine on my IPhone 11 Pro and my husband uses his to charge his iPhone XS Max.  They work great. Fast charge and slim design.  Would buy again!
","
Love the white color… get yours!
","
I love the stylish design.  Looks great on my nightstand.  The LED lights add just enough light to find my phone in the dark without being too bright.  The thin nature of the unit it makes it unassuming and easy to use.  I haven't been able to time the charging as it is always full after a nights sleep.  Perfect fit for my needs .The only slight negative is the glass top can show finger prints but with my iPhone Xs it really isn't a problem.
","
Definitely was expecting what the picture shown instead it's more like a tan color
","
This is the first time I’ve ever owned this type of charger and it’s very easy to use and very convenient. I wish that I would’ve discovered this sooner it’s a lot easier than plug in your phone into a charger now I can just lay it on the charger.It more than met my expectations.
","
I ordered two, a black one and a white one. One is for work and the other for at home. The white one did not come with the USB-C adapter and I reached out to the manufacturer for support and they were glad to help. Overall a great product and charges great.
","
Easy to use
","
I was able to just set the little product on there and get a charging, with little bother. I also like that it doesn’t have a big glowy thing, but just a tiny light, and that clearly indicates if somethings charging or not. That way you weren’t burning a lot of excess energy I needlessly. So far it’s working great.
","
I bought the charger not knowing if it would work but I’ve been using it to charge my phone since it areived. The charging power is great and its wasy to use as well. You will need a usb port for plug-in though. I highly recommend people buy the wireless charger.
","
It won't provide high speed cordless charging until you buy an additional  (not included) cord for it. Once the circle is plugged into. The extra cord you have to buy, then it should be able to charge a device laid upon it's disc.
","
I don't like it. It really doesn't charge my phone right. It says full but it's not charge fully.
","
Seems to work great to charge my TOZO earbuds. Doesn't work at all on my Moto G7 phone. Instructions are worthless; tiny and incomplete. Neither the microscopic instructions or the website even tell what the color of the lights means. I tried all their troubleshooting tips. Probably works fine on some phones. It's attractive and well made. No response from their tech support folks.
","
Stylish and compact, this charging pad has a quality feel and is quick to charge our iPhones, Google phones and TOZO earbuds. Love the look of the Gold color!
","
Really nice charger for the price. It’s heavy enough to stay in place on a table and has a really nice finish. Seems to work well enough for my iPhone 11, although I don’t have a baseline since this is my first Qi charger. I just used an old iPhone wall plug since this product does not include an AC adapter.
","
Wireless charger is better than I expected, it charges my iPhone +8 toooo I only got it to charge my TOZO 6 Bluetooth!! It’s a WIN WIN if you ask me!!!I just got it so not sure of long term use but for now I’m satisfied!!
","
I use this on my Samsung Note 20 5g and it works great. I usually just charge my phone at night and it lasts all day. I think it take a couple of hours to get a full charge which is longer than with a normal charger. To me its not a big deal since like I stated, I just charge it at night.
","
I use this charging pad all the time. It's very convenient than trying to find the plug to plug in my device. It's slim and looks nice. I can easily stand it up on It's side so it doesn't take up space when I am done using it
","
Works for new iPhone with mag charging also had a case on phone and still works isn't as fast as the expensive mag chargers but normal use is fine, want to speed it up buy a fancy adapter that allows this to charge at top speed either way works great no complaints.
","
A sleek and minimal charger that looks good in space and gets the job done. It looks premium and I love the light feature that shows whether you phone is charging or not, depending on the color of the light.  However, keep in mind that the charger did come with a card that said that they'll give a year warranty if you write a 5 star review.
","
Pretty color and easy to use!! Has a nice smooth feel to it, but also feels slip resistant.
","
Purchased this about a week ago.  Quality is very and it’s very responsive.  Packaging is top notch too.  I usually charge my phone overnight, so I can not speak to the speed of the phone being charged.  What I can say is that it has always been at 100% battery life in the morning when I start my day.I’m going to order another for my wife and one for work.  I wish I would have made this move a long time ago.
","
I tried this and it worked for my ear buds.  I tried it with my iPhone and you have to lay it a certain way for it to work. One time it did not charge because it was laid wrong I guess. Not a fan of this.
","
I haven’t tried the charger yet but so far it looks as promised.  I will be able to tell more after using it a few times.
","
Product works as described!  Needed a replacement after my OEM Samsung wireless charger just wasn't cutting the mustard.  Cool LED indicator shows functionality.  The damn thing just looks cool.  The photos pictured shows the charger by itself and also with some Pamu headphones charging to show charging LED indicators.Would recommend.  Great form factor and function!!
","
Don't waste money on something that charges slow when you can just got to Walmart and buy for a cheaper price that works the same. It takes four hours to charge my Android phone. That's how ridiculous this charging is. The only good thing I can say is, that this charger is thin, lightweight, and a good travel size.
","
I bought this to have on my very visible desk in a studio space. Clients can see everything that's on my desk and I didn't want something that looked like a stereotypical wireless charger: big, bulky, and black. This is a small disk that essentially looks like a coaster. No one would ever know it's a wireless charger. I do, however, wish charging was a little quicker and it does not come with a block, so keep that in mind!
","
iPhone will not charge unless laying on the exact spot.  Had for 2 months. Just placing in the pad and walking away you may find it never charged.  Verifying it is charging before walking away, it works great.
","
This is easy to set up.  Plug it in and it's ready to go.  Slow charging is a thing of the past.
","
Purchased for my daughter and she loves the color. It’s slim profile makes it easy for her to take with her when we travel too. No issues with it and charges her iPhone just fine.
","
I've only had it a week so I can't speak to longevity, but it works great so far.It feels well made, the edges and seams are all clean, it's light without feeling flimsy.I have a Galaxy S20+ and the pad is connected to a charger from a Pixel 2 and it fast charges just fine.
","
I love how no matter how you set your phone on it, it charges & quickly! I had a bad experience with another cheap wireless charger so I did many reviews on many different ones before I came across this one, I am so glad this product wasn't so expensive but actually worked & so well! So pleased with this buy!!
","
This charger is great for phones and headphones. It charged my Tozo earbuds so quickly and my phone in half the time as my cord. However my wireless charger doesn’t light up as stated. I am contacting them to let them know the problem.Update: After contacting them, they apologized and are sending out a replacement charger. Great customer service!!
","
I bought this charger about a month ago and have not had any problems with the product. It came on time thanks to amazon primes two day shipping. I use the charger every day, I keep it on my bed side table and put my phone on it before I fall asleep. Every morning when I wake up my phone is fully charged and ready for the day. The most impressive feature that the product charges my phone with my case still on the phone. Great product would recommend to anyone.
","
Very easy to use and doesn’t take forever to charge my phone. I love I can charge my wireless Tozo ear buds also
","
This is a really pretty charger; wish I can give it 10 stars for the look. However, I haven’t used but it enough hour to decide if the charging power is good. On the first night I felt that it’s not as fast as my old (not apple) wireless charger, but I’ll give it a few days and come back to update.
","
I learned to operate charger by trial and errorInstructions are too small
","
They work great and not overpriced
","
Works good, nice thin and small size not bulky, very sleek looks cool! Very easy to use. This is my 1st wireless charger and I love how u can just lay your phone on it no more messing with trying to plug your phone in in the dark. The lights are nice to know where to lay your phone and they're not to bright for sleeping. Would be neat if it would have a magnet in to hold your phone on but overall I like it pretty good.
","
10/10 recommend except the fact you can’t have a magnetic case, or else it will interfere with charging battery.
","
This is my first wireless charger. Setup was easy, it works wonderfully, and I enjoy the little green/blue LEDs on the side that tell you the charge status. Don't know how it'll hold up during travel as I haven't used it for that, but for right now it's great at home.
","
This is supposed to be fast charging for Samsung products, but it will not fast charge my S21.  Only performs standard speed.  Returning.
","
Update: have bought multiple chargers to have a wireless base in every room, really sleek and subtle on our side tables. Continue to be very happy with this purchase._____________________________________Just received this charger - very classy appearance, and the glass with gold accents perfectly matches my iPhone. The charging indicator lights are very subtle, just a soft glow that is mostly covered when the phone is on the charger so it doesn’t disturb sleep at all. Excellent customer service from TOZO, I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase another.
","
This has been amazing for traveling. Take it everywhere I go. So easy. Hotel rooms sometimes chargers don’t work but this has been great to lay it down and let it charge. Don’t have to worry about it disconnecting in the night.
","
I like the look and easy of this product. It beats having to plug in my phone. Blue it is charging then turns green when the charge is complete. Excellent
","
Bought this charger for my desk at work. I have an 11pro iphone. I put my phone on the charger and my phone says its charging, but charged maybe 3% in an hour. Its good to just ""keep your phone on"" if its dying but don't expect to it actually give it juice. I HIGHLY do not recommend.
","
This is an excellent wireless charger. I purchased it because the other Amazon Prime charger I bought a few weeks ago does not work with my iPhone 11 with case. I have to remove the case before charging the phone. I purchased this one with doubt (for communication distance up to 8mm I saw in product description). However it works perfectly beyond my expectation. This charger is also beautifully made. It is extremely thin and looks elegant with shinning metal and glass top. Highly recommended.
","
Clean and sleek design. Thinner than I imagined. Haven’t had any issues charging with case on.
","
I just received this, but I like it so far. Takes quite a while to charge
","
I just got the charger and it worked. It looks nice. I can’t say anything about the longevity of it working but so far so good.
","
Like the device which I order it due to the LED to help locate it at night.
","
This is my first wireless charger.  I wanted something that was thin and less expensive than others I have seen. I looked at some reviews and this one by Tozo looked good like a good quality.  Well packaged. It is just as advertised.  You will need an AC adapter like it says. The light is a nice touch.  Kind of neat when not charging and it indicates when the phone is positioned properly for charging. I use it with a fairly heavy phone case and it works fine.
","
Works perfectly
","
I loved it when it arrived. It seemed to be working fine. Then I began noticing that it wasn't charging as fast as when it first arrived. I had issues with it working but then their customer service stepped in and actually replaced the faulty charger and now I'm completely satisfied. I'm glad because I really do like the design and function of this charger. Definitely recommend.
","
Super slim and aesthetic, doesn't fast charge my Note20 Ultra but would recommend anyways as it does its job of charging
","
Very easy to use. Just lay your phone on top. However, only 4 stars as it takes a long time to charge.
","
Product works well, have it placed by my bed so I can just plop my phone down and not worry about plugging it in at the end of the day, adds a slight increase of quality of life. Works with the case on my phone too. Definitely recommend, especially for the price point.
","
I really like these new MagSafe chargers, it is a must buy with a new iPhone 12. This one is sleek and affordable and would be perfect if the cord was a foot or two longer. To be clear it’s fine for leaving on the nightstand but I was hoping to be able to use the phone while it charged and it’s coming up short.
","
I really like this product. I especially like the way it looks, the white with the gold trim gives a sophisticated look. the slim, sleek look, I love, takes little space on my desk. The charging is very very good, the only thing I find a little annoying is, you have to make sure the phone is placed just right for it to begin charging. But at least the light gives indications when it's placed correctly. It fits just right in my backpack pocket cause it not bulky.
","
Haven't owned one of these before, so I may not be the best judge of quality and features, but it charges my wireless earbuds very quickly and I really like that I don't have to plug it in anymore. My next phone will definitely have wireless charging capabilities. I would recommend this charger without hesitation.
","
Very slim and sleek design. It sits a little less than 4 quarters high. Much better looking than my Samsung charger. The case on the sides and bottom is metal. Top is a thin layer of plastic which likely makes the charging capabilities better. Seems to be good quality. Comes with 3ft usb-c cord. Overall I’m satisfied
","
I had wanted to get a wireless charger for my Google Pixel 3XL. This was a great find! It isn't the fastest charger, which I didn't expect it to be the fastest for my type of phone. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge. I do recommend. It's an awesome price for one!
","
Easy to use, and charger earphones perfectly, iPhones 8plus and newer it can also charge, but charges, but doesn’t charge as fast. overall good wireless charger
","
I was seriously skeptical as I haven’t even tried the wireless charging and assumed only the expensive ones would work. I was wrong, this charger is sleek and modern. Everyone loves setting there phone, AirPods & watches down for a quick charging. So easy & convenient. I’m blown away and ordering more.
","
The look and design is what I needed. The easiest to setup and use. That is what I wanted.
","
I really like this charger. I thought it wore out at four months, but it was my problem.I googled it and found out I had to restart my iPhone. But that was after I tried threeothers and had the same problem. Just had to reset my iPhone.
","
I have liked this product much more than I anticipated.  I have it on my desk, and it is very easy to set my headphone or phone on to charge them without having to sort out which cord to plug in.  It is low priced, so worth getting!
","
I liked the color but it didn't work with my phone. It does work with an iphone
","
I just received the charger , it was easy to set up, charged my phone fast and fits in my backpack for travel. I love the green light. I will be happy about not having to worry a my plug in end breaking on my charge cords.
","

 Always happy with my other Tozo products. This  wireless charger works well too. It comes with a usb-c cable and an adapter for USB.  It is compact and easy to use. I love that it can charge my Tozo earbuds too.
","
Amazing choice for a wireless charger for my Iphone XS MAX. I'm impressed how compact, lightweight, and well designed this charger is for the price point. Also it starts charging right away as soon as put your phone on the charger. My XS max charges quickly even without taking the case off.Black shiny color further and LED lights look great. I like the soft green light that signals the phone is set on the charger correctly and the connection is made. This is a must have charger for wireless phones. Charging is quick. Highly recommend.
","
My previous charger, I had to move the phone around a little to get it to pick up.  This one is so big, my s20 Note picks up as soon as I put it on.  The lights are not distracting for me at all either.  A big improvement over our prior chargers.
","
I thought this would be cute to go with my desk theme but the charging doesn’t work. This is my second one bc the first one was defective and still I’m very disappointed.
","
Did not work on my LG android phone...but worked on my daughters I Phone so I gave it to her.
","
The packaged arrived very quick and in excellent conditions. It was super easy to use and it worked like a charm! It is a very well-made product with quality materials and has a perfect proportion to put on a small desk like mine. I am very happy with it and would 100% recommend to anyone!
","
Tested this guy, plug in claimed 1:02 minutes, this item 1:43 minutes!Compared to my last one where discharge was faster then charge I'd say this thing is great! Little slower then a plug in, but honestly if I am setting it down I'm probably asleep and that's a perfectly fine charge rate.  Especially for the money! Probably buy another one and one for my wife!
","
Didn’t charge my AirPods like it said that it would.
","
I bought one of these a year ago and have loved it so much I purchased 3 more this year! I like the light up feature on the sides because I often go looking for my phone at night in a dark room and it allows me to find it on the charger! They are beautifully designed as well.
","
This is our second Tozo charger, and they are solid devices, that charge our phones at a good rate.  I like the thin profile, and where some chargers have a narrow range where they fail to charge, these seem to be large enough to reduce that worry.
","
Easy to set up, quick charging capability and so portable.
","
Simple and easy, a good product, buy itWhat could be better:The charge time it’s slower than cable, but don’t mind if you got the time.The cable connection should be and iphone cable.4 stars for me.
","
The slim design makes it virtually invisible on the table. Good looking as well.
","
Bought the first wireless charger and it worked intermittently (as described in some posts) then I reached out to Tozo and they sent me a replacement.  All is working great!  The customer service was fast and kind.  I really appreciated Tozostore going the extra mile - excellent customer service.  Will buy their products again!
","
I like the convenience of having this wireless charger plugged in and being able to just place my AirPods or iPhone on it for charging.Sometimes it does take a couple of tries to be sure the devise is placed on the charger where it actually charges.
","
Good price.  Convenient.  Great to not have to fumble with a cord to charge.
","
I use this wireless charger at work. It's great the slim design makes it easy to tuck anywhere near my computer or other convenient place. It chargers almost as quickly as my phone's original charger, so that's also great. It doesn't come with an AC adapter, so there are fewer options if I travel, but since you can plug this stuff into modern TVs and many planes now have USB ports, it's not as much a concern as it used to be. Thumbs up.
","
Nice Charger, Great Price
","
I received my Tozo charger and I love it. It’s slim and sleek. Has two small grips on the bottom so it doesn’t slide. You just lay your cell phone on the pad to charge without having to actually plug it is very convenient. Has lights when on which is a nice touch and doesn’t bother me at all when I’m going to sleep. This charger comes in handy. Will be getting another one for work. If your hesitant about purchasing, don’t be. You won’t be disappointed.
","
Super easy to use and charges phone great. My only complaint is the chord is a little short, and the light is bright. I can’t use it to charge my phone at night as the light keeps me up, but is perfect to use at the office
","
I like when it changes colour when it's done charging, however it heats up extremely too much when finished charging my earbuds. but i still like it.
","
This charger is great. Its my first, so I don't have any to compare it to, but it's boxed nicely.When removing it from the package, it does seem to be made of good quality material, and it looks super sleek. I love how the green lights turn to blue when it's charging. Bought another one for the wife,and she loves hers too.
","
The charging power is amazing. It’s so quick and efficient when you’re in a rush or half woken up at 5am....to check the time on your phone & can easily remove and place back the phone without worrying about a cord. It’s such a nice gadget to have. 10/10 would total recommend as a gift.
","
It works well. I like the indicator light so I know that my phone is actually charging. It seems to be good quality that will last.
","
Just received. Haven't had a chance to use yet. Will update.Look is very sleek.+++++++++++*Update*Works great! No issues with connection!And, it's charges faster than my last wireless charger.No negatives so far!
","
30 minutes later only 10% charged. If you got a thick phone case it won’t work. Does not charge Apple Watch ⌚️
","
This wireless charger is very sleek nice design and it does work it just charges super slow
","
I love this charger. My phone is old so the battery runs down pretty fast so I just walked in the house and set it on the charger and it charges fast Fast and easy and then if you need it you can just grab it right off the charger.  No plugging and unplugging.
","
I was looking for the thinnest charging pad out there, and I found it. Exactly what I was looking for. LEDs aren't full circle so if my phone is at a certain angle I can't tell if it's charging or not, but that's the only thing I wish were different. From a dead battery my phone will full charge in 3 hours which is about what I expect from a wireless charger. Also, this thing is pocket portable! Only a little bigger than my wallet. 5 stars
","
I purchased 4 of these for around my house. 1 has stopped working entirely it just flashes from blue to green and doesn’t connect. The one in my bedroom is now charging at an alarming slow rate. I put my phone on before bed and it still wasn’t charged by this morning..... worked well at first but not holding up
","
I like this charger for when I’m at home or in the office since I can just put my phone down and keep doing what I was doing
","
Does it’s purpose. Doesn’t have a lot of charging power.
","
I love the sleek stylish design of this charger. It's so great to be able to have my phone nearby and always charging.  I love being able to use it as soon as I need it without unplugging or needing to plug back in.  I work in high end luxury sales and am in and out of the office and on my phone a big part of each day. I haven't had an issue with running out of battery since I bought my Tozo. Highly recommend!
","
I have two of these and they work great. Charges the phone quickly and so far have been reliable. They are relatively small and low profile.
","
It is a wireless charger where you don’t have to hook it up to the phone . I was looking for a charger that’s wireless completely but this is very high-quality and it charges through my OtterBox on my 11 promax
","
This wireless charger works perfect with my iPhone 11. The design is beautiful and it is much thinner than my old charger. It will be great if there is option to include power adapter.
","
Started using these type of charging units  when my iPhone 8+ was no longer charging by cord.  This saved me from having to buy new phone. Lights up blue so you know that it’s charging.  Love using this device!!
","
You can tell if your phone is on the charger properly, by the outer ring lighting up! The Tozo charger is thin & light, with a very sleek design !
","
Small and good loocking
","
This is a great wireless charger.  I was hoping for one that was discreet and I could still find in the dark.  The light is just bright enough to find with the lights off, but does not disturb the dark room at all.  The charging surface is dark and blends into the surface of my night stand, making for a very clean appearance.  Charges great. Just set phone in the middle and it connects immediatly.  Probably gonna buy another one for my husband.
","
Okay first off, this charger is so aesthetically pleasing. It's very sleek.Secondly Charging power --> It works as it should! It definitely isn't the fastest, but I bought it to use while I studied at my desk or overnight and works very well for that.Charging wire is provided! It is a solid length, a bit shorter than an iphone charging wire would be.In general, it's very easy to use. Just plug and put your phone on. Viola. I'm happy with my purchase
","
charges significantly slower than my iphone cord
","
very nice
","
This charger looks very elegant, is ultra thin, and charges all of my devices.  I use this to charge my iPhone XS at work and I have had a few people ask for a product link because it looks very nice in an office environment unlike some other products.  The charger has also had no problem charging through any phone case.  Another aspect that I appreciate is the use of USB-C.  It’s nice to see manufacturers finally adopting this connector.Highly recommend!
","
I bought this as a gift for my best friend. She likes it, but it can be tricky to use with her case and pop socket on it. She can’t take the case off easily. Her husband has basically taken it over. He has a thick case and yet it works perfectly for him.
","
I use this for my Hyper X wireless gaming headset and it works great. Price is very affordable and they use very good quality materials. Also the aesthetics of the charger is quite nice. It is very sleek looking and I really like the lights on the sides. Plus it comes with a year warranty. Overall it seems like a great product so far.
","
Bought this for my mom who lives out of town. This charger does not plug into an outlet. You have to run it through wifi using a laptop or computer. Even after all that, it still doesn't work. I can't get any of our phones to charge. Can't return now cause it's been too long. Save your money and don't purchase this!
","
Everyone in my office has this charger. Got one for myself for home. Looks really nice and isn't made of cheap plastic. Really like it. 5 stars, only minor issue (which isn't bad, just preference) is that it has green lights on at all times. They are subtle but I like it pitch black when sleeping.
","
Yes, it can charge a phone wirelessly. But you need to put the phone in the EXACT center, maybe jostle it around a little until it picks up the charge. Also the connection to power gets a little shoddy as the lights will blink on and off sometimes. I'm not sure it's better than a wired charger, but it ain't terrible neither.
","
I had used this charger for months and it was perfect to use. Then one day it just gave out. It was not the chord or anything but the charger itself. It was honestly disappointing.
","
I have two TOZO products now. The T6 wireless earbuds and now this wireless charger. They both work, as expected. You get great affordability and durability with TOZO and I think their products are getting better in terms of quality. It's a great company to invest in overall.
","
The charger heated up the metal ring stand on the back of my phone case.  It was so hot I dropped it.  I will be taking the phone out of the case before using it again.
","
I love the look of this charger, but it only charges off and on. The light turns blue as if it’s charging and then a minute or so later it’s green and no longer charging. I don’t have a case on my phone either. —UPDATE: the seller reached out to me and offered to send me a new one for free. Once I put a case on my phone it seemed to charge perfectly!
","
I got this as a gift for my wife, she recently got an iPhone XR and wanted to go the wireless charging route.  This charger is amazingly thin and light and looks so clean she loved it.  We have had no issues with it charging her phone, even through an Otterbox Symmetry case and two small metal plates surrounding the wireless coil (for Scosche MagicMount car charger).  We are both very impressed with how well it charges.  I'm glad I got this for her.
","
The charging disc stays lit All the time ! Which is annoying ... you can disconnect it if not in use !Charge is relatively quick but Not as quick as my Samsung charging disc
","
Pretty simple charger except the only problem is is that it has to be a USB charger not a wall charger but other than that everything I’ve put on it hit charges and works great
","
Super easy to set up, thin design makes it ideal for travel.
","
Useful but slow charge cute design but thought it was bigger is probably the size of my hand and my hand is average takes too much time to get battery fully charged maybe more than hour but does the job so far needed a charger and decided to try wireless version let’s see how long this lasts
","
******Good Product *****
","
it takes an hour to charge my phone just 4-5% more, and overheats my airpods. looks nice on my desk though. i would not buy it again.
","
Easy to use,  charges at same rate as standard Apple charger, slight temperature increase when using.
","
I love this product, it works very well. I thought it would charge as fast as if you plugged it in, but when i set it down it says 1hr 32min when i plugged it in it said 45min but I think it charged faster then what it said with the charging pad.love the led lighting and the sleek design of the charging pad.  its a must if this is what you are looking for and your phone supports  it. I have a Samsung s9.
","
Looks good and feels solid. Does not slide on my nightstand do to rubber pads on bottom.
","
The look of this charger is lovely! Thin and sexy. The product is hard to use. You spend way to much time trying to line your phone up to charge then it’s worth. I ended up purchasing a different brand that works amazing . It’s not as thin or sexy but it works!
","
I just received my order. The charger is very thin as advertised and my iPhone 11 with case charges no matter how I lay it on the surface. I don’t have to search for that “sweet spot”.It did come with a cord- I would have preferred a longer cord, but it works fine. I’m using an adapter I had on hand, so let’s see how the next few days go.
","
I have a bought a couple of wireless chargers (other than Tozo W1) either they are just short of juice or they can’t power through a UAG case for my iPhone 11 max pro. This one does the job. Works well with iPhone 11 Pro Max.
","
This product is great! It has a nice sleek clean design and it works really well. As soon as I put my phone on it with or without my case on it starts charging and it even has a color light indicator to let you know if it’s still charging from far away! I love it and I’m glad I picked this product. Charges pretty quickly too and the company has great customer service! I even got a 1 year warranty! Buy it, it’s worth it!
","
Great product, built solid not like some other crap i have bought. Charges quickly and through my case with a pop-socket on it with no problem.
","
Received a unit from seller to test. Charger itself works really well, charged the charging case for my wireless earbuds no problem. Pad is really slick looking, black glass with color changing LEDs to display charging status. Only wish it came with a wall plug, since it only comes with the pad and a USB cable. Fast shipping, super responsive seller.
","
Worthy productsTrustworthy
","
Its ok sometimes it charges  and sometimes it doesn't.  I thought it would be larger but it wasn't, and its good for travel.  It charges fast.  I do wish the colors were red instead of blue for not charging  and green for good charge
","
It’s very tiny and cute, don’t underestimate how small it is though. It’s perfect for my small nightstand and I have it as my designated AirPod charger, I’m glad I don’t have to switch around sharing my regular iPhone charger with it anymore and it has its own place at all times now.
","
I’ve had this item for two months. I use it occasionally, but not every day. Today it was working then after using it 2 hours later I plug it in and it starts blinking green for not compatible. There is no device even on it. Tried different cords and still not working. Tried to get support help and website won’t work. Will buy elsewhere.
","
ease to use and charges real fast
","
Simple plug and play. Looks great on a desk. Traveling convenience to add.
","
I LOVE my new Tozo wireless charger! I got the gold trim one and am impressed with my purchase. Great value for money. Sleek sophisticated appearance and it has a helpful lighting which changed colour from green to blue when your phone is charging.I previously brought another more expensive and more bulky one from the Apple store for my new IPhone 11 and returned it back within a week as it overheated my phone. Not an issue with the Tozo charger!Recommend!
","
I haven’t tried any wireless chargers before, this is the first one i bought and charged my phone. It works great, it met all my expectations. It’s so easy to use and led lights helps you to see if your phone is charging, the light turns to blue when charging and green on stand by. No need to deal with cables. The only negative side is that you cannot use your phone while it’s charging because it has to stay on the charging pad flat while charging.
","
The charger looks awesome, but it works even better! The magnet is able to attach to my phone through my otter box case, which is a huge plus. I’ve used other magnetic wireless chargers, and they wouldn’t attach to the phone. Problem solved by buying the Tozo charger. Great for charging fast too!
","
Easy to use, but have to remove my cover from my phone for it to charge.
","
Charges my TOZO t6 earbuds, my phone, and even a little reading light I have.  Its so straight forward and convenient and just wish I owned it before the holidays because its a good gift idea.My favorite thing about it is probably the materials. Looks good on my desk and feels solid.
","
This item does not charge through my mom's wallet case,  but it does charge through my clear plastic case.  The USB circuit I use is a 3A and it charges fairly quickly.  Not as fast as when it's plugged in,  but works good.  I like the look of the charger.
","
Just received my Tozo wireless charger yesterday and trying it for the first time now “will update my review later if needed”.The packaging is really good, and the charger is very slim and so convenient for traveling and moving around with it without hassle, I really love how it looks and feels 😊As for it’s efficiency, I’ll need to try it out for a couple of times to know if it’s up to my expectations but so far so good.
","
Works well but make sure u center ur device on the charger or it won’t charge
","
This is a well-made and attractive wireless charger. The size makes it effective without having to worry about landing your phone on just the right spot, as with many other wireless chargers. It’s thin and still small enough to slip into a computer bag or suitcase.I just ordered a third, if that tells you anything.
","
Product is great, love the sleek design, it seems much more sturdy than the other wireless charger I bought years ago. My only complaint is that it does not come with its own usb wall outlet adapter. Luckily I had purchased one with this.
","
I have been using this charger stand-alone for about 2 months, with my 5W Apple charger, and it is working great.
","
Love this! I have it on my desk at work and it’s perfect! It looks elegant and nice instead of messy cords on your desk. It charges my iPhone 11pro perfectly. I’m always skeptic about chargers that aren’t apple products since they’re picky on what works with their phones but this charges great!
","
This charger worked great up until yesterday when it wouldn't turn blue/charge.  I get a green flashing light but it's pretty much dead.  Not even a year old.
","
I love these little charges! I have them all over. I even took one to work. No more plugging and unplugging my phone. Charges right through my phone case. Got one for my mom for Mother’s Day and she loved it.
","
This is a sleek charger. I like the light display that shows whether it's charging or not. When I ordered it, I didn't realize that it has to be plugged in (to a usb port)  to use. I was looking for one that was a stand alone charger. That being said, it works well, and honestly, you can never have too many chargers.
","
there are so few good quality products out there- seems to me this is one. havent used them for long, but solid build seems like it might last for some time. these are very simple devices after all, with good materials should last.
","
It came with a weird dent in it, so I was worried that I recieved a broken one. However, it works just fine to charge my earbuds and their case. It doesnt seem to work at all for my phone, but I can get over it. It looks nice aside from the dent and has a good size.
","
Happy with the charger.  As seen in my picture, this thing is as thin as a regular pencil which makes traveling easy and compact.  Arch light/Charging status light is on top of the charger instead of on the side like most chargers.  With that said, If you have a bigger phone (iphone max/note 10+), it might be a little difficult to see the light since it will cover up most of the light.  Other than that, this product is beautiful.
","
No me gustó que solo el centro sea el contacto de carga
","
This charger is the best charger you can buy and the price is great. After researching wireless chargers that were way more expensive I came across this one and decided to give it a try and I haven’t been disappointed. I like the fact that it’s small and compact with the charging indicators on pad, green is ready and it will turn blue when you put your phone on it to let you it’s charging. Charging time is fast and no overheating. Well worth the money love it!
","
It is hard to fit your phone on it just right to charge. You have to line it up and it  It's hard to tell where to put it. If you want a charger that's easy to just put your phone  on and walk away, this in not it. The only thing I liked was it is thin and small.
","
Everything it works great
","
This product arrived in 1 day which was great. The design is a very modern sleek look, which LED indicator lights to let you know that the product is charging or fully charged. I'm glad the LED lights aren't too bright, as that could be distracting when trying to sleep. The lights are still visible enough to see easily in daylight.Charging power seems pretty standard. Wish the connector cable was a bit longer, but can't complain. I would recommend this charger!
","
This shipped quickly and I usurp ut almost immediately after unboxing and plugging in the usb chord to an adapter. Wireless charging is great.The actual charging surface is white while the rose gold color is the underside that sits on the table. It’s great I’d buy another is another color for variety.I’ll update this review after a few more uses
","
Charges through my life proof case! I wish there was a way to turn off the blue/green charging light.
","
Bought this to charge my tozo wireless earbuds, but it also work on my iPhone 12 even with a case on it. Very easy to use, just plug it in and put whatever you are charging on top. Lights up blue while charging. Also comes with a one year warranty.
","
This charger is exactly what I was looking for.  I use a Q1 receiver with this device and my phone charges at a great rate.  I don't have to worry about it losing charge faster or anything along those lines.  I am definitely satisfied with my purchase.
","
Came in perfect condition and is a great size to carry with me everywhere!
","
Its so sleek and nice, but when a phone is charging on it, the lights on the side flash teal to blue... the whole time..... and when I'm trying to sleep it can be a bit annoying. I wish there was a way to turn them off, but there are no switches or buttons on the device, just non-slip pads on the base and a usb-c plug.Otherwise, does what it says, charges efficiently.
","
Easy to use, fits iPhone pro perfect, great for travel
","
Great design and quality. Doesn't appear to charge very fast. Interferes with phone swipe gestures with a stylus.
","
Small. Ez 2 use.
","
I like this wireless charger a lot because it’s so much easier to use than some of the other chargers and lightning cables that I’ve used before.
","
This was my 7th product from Tozo and have yet to be disappointed. This very slim flat charger, surprisingly charges my Note 10+ very quickly. Green LED on the front changes to blue when charging and returns to green when my phone reaches 100% charge. It's economical, unobtrusive, does it's job, and informs when competes it's task. What more could I want?
","
It only does the charger looks sleek but the magnets are strong. I can pick my phone up by the cord without the phone falling off. It works with a case on it. They provide a type c to USB A adapter. It charges fast if you use a type c outlet adapter.
","
This product is thin, lightweight, beautiful, and sleekly designed! Super easy to use (just plug in, peel off the protective sticker, and it’s ready to charge) and also offers an extended 1-year warranty (make sure to register your product). I bought two (one in white/rose gold and another in space grey) to put in my office and my bedroom - great for the price!
","
For some reason my iPhone end up moving off the platform all the time which unable the phone to charge. Probably because the platform is glass and iPhone too.  I let it charged overnight and found my phone with no battery at all because the phone moved off the platform.  I mean I could have gotten a regular charger for the same prime :/ no happy.
","
Fast charging.
","
I used this while in the hospital after surgery so I did not have to worry about any other chords. It’s a pretty pink color and charged my phone and headphones quickly.
","
Elegant design, so slim it blends in with decor easily. Does not slide around at all despite being so lightweight.Update: no matter what charging block i use (45w PD from Anker, 65w PD from Ravpower, 20w pd from Ravpower, 10w usb-a port) my S21 ultra will not fast wireless charge, only 5 w charges. Other pads are capable of charging at 10 w, so it is the pad itself.
","
Very slim and modern looking. Charges up my Samsung Galaxy S10+ very quickly. It just works and looks good. What more is there to say. I have one in the bedroom and one in the kitchen. I am thinking about putting one in my car. Very pleased with my purchase.
","
I bought this because of the sleep friendly aspect, but it isn't really sleep friendly at all. The lights on it are pretty bright. Something that really annoys me about this product is that you have to have the phone positioned on it ""JUST"" right, or it won't charge. You pretty much have to have a wireless charging friendly case, because if you set your naked iphone on this, it will just slide right off. I pretty much only use this charger as a spare, I wouldn't rely on it as a main charger. It is very pretty though, so if you care about aesthetically pleasing things over functionality, you will like this product.
","
it does its job but with some restrictions, can't have phone case while charging and it is slow in charging love the look of it but definitely needs improvement in functionality
","
Every one In my family have these expensive $60 chargers and when I bought this… they all were jealous of how cool mine was.. lights change color when charging and the color lets you know when charging is done.. which is super fast as well.
","
I don't think I know how to use this product so I can't give a great review I plugged it in it charged then what the cord could do the same thing
","
Excellent little charger, gets the job done and comes in great colors too. I chose the rose gold trim and it’s very pretty in a subtle way. I also like that the white color is easy to see in the dark (vs black base) and thus makes it easy to find the charger base at night.
","
I've had this product for about a month now and I love how sleek and visually appealing it is, but gosh it's so finicky! I  occasionally find myself waking up in the morning with a phone that didn't charge, which is frustrating. You have to sit and watch for a few seconds after placing it on the charger to insure it continues to charge. It's cute if you're looking for something visually appealing, just beware of your phone placement.
","
I was encouraged by my son to look at the Tozo wireless charger.  He has had one for a long time. I had recently upgraded my phone, and was tired of hunting wires and hitting holes in the phone for charging.  The Tozo charger did the trick. It is esthetically pleasing, takes up very little room on the table, and I can get my phone charged without standing on my head to hunt the plug that has fallen to the floor.
","
Just received wireless charger and pleasantly surprised on how well it charges with a phone case on.  Glad I purchased two.
","
Love it. Powerful and really cool design in a small package
","
I like that the unit lets you visually see if your phone is charging by going from green to blue. I wish that it charged the phones quicker, but the ease of use when traveling is good.
","
Its works really well, I just wish it charged more then just the head phones
","
Purchased this for charging my Tozo ear buds but find myself using it for my iPhone more often. Charges great even with my case on. It is a slower charge than plugging it up, but a lot less wires to deal with.
","
Compact, easy to use, convenient.
","
Replaced a standup Samsung stand with this. That stand was hard to keep the phone in the correct placement. This one is so easy to use and takes up little space. It does not seem to give off much heat and for my use age recovers the battery in great time. The only distraction is that I have to use their cord as the plug socket is not new style Samsung compatible. Otherwise, great for a reasonable price.Started out fine but died in less than 6 months.
","
It’s a beautiful design but it just charges when it wants. It’s not reliable because you wake up in the morning and it may not have charged your phone.I always wake up in the night and lots of times it didn’t charge at all. I unplug, do more stuff and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.Better stay with your regular cords!
","
I have had other wireless charger in the past where if it was placed a little off it will not charge. I chose to try this one because it’s easy to use and I can just place my phone anywhere and it charges. Very satisfied.
","
I bought this to charge a wireless mouse - it works perfectly and the larger size makes it a great fit.  I really like this product especially given the price and slick look-and-feel with a black shiny surface and glow to incident if powered on or charging.  Great product....
","
I like that when my phone is done charging that the charger’s blue light turns green signaling a full charge.
","
Not only is it sleek and visually pleasing but it works for so many other devices to charge. Love it
","
Compact, slick design. Charges quick and looks great. Definitely Recommended
","
Easy setup, kinda slow charging. Fairly small so it doesn’t take up much space & can easily be used for traveling.
","
It works, but plan to need A LOT more charging time than you think because it cannot handle Quick Charge 3.0 chargers (even with a Quick Charge cable). What takes 1-hour for Quick Charging, might take 3+ hours for this wireless charging device... Almost not worth the hassle.
","
I like that the Tozo wireless charger is basically ready to go right out of the box. I’m impressed so far with the charging capabilities and with the high-quality feel of the charger itself; it’s a great value. It even does a commendable job charging up my IPhone as well 👍
","
I have a ""Lovehandle"" on my phone and I love this charger.  It works with the handle.My kids bought a MUCH more expensive charger from the Apple store.  They can't use it without taking the phone out of its case, so they don't use it.It's so much simpler than plugging in the phone each night.
","
Up to now I am very impressed. The aluminum casing is welcome change from plastic. Looks good also and not too intrusive being only 5mm thick.
","
this works great for me, especially if I'm on the go.  its a fast charge for my phone especially when I am not around any outlets to use such as when I am trail riding, biking or hiking.  fits easily in my backpack!  highly recommend this product!
","
This charger works great with a popsocket on the back of the phone case! The manufacturing quality is 100% on spot. It looks very nice and worked great right out of the box. The packaging was very well designed too. Will buy another one soon.
","
I use this charger for my iPhone XS Max with Unicorn Beetle SUPCASE and Nomad Leather case and both work great with it. The charger is thin being slightly larger than an average coaster so it does not take up too much space and packs easily for transport. I also have used it to charge my wife's Samsung Galaxy S8 with an Otterbox Defender case and that works as well. I recommend this charger and am planning to get another one for my wife.
","
Product looks good.  Easy to use and works very well for the price.
","
Just as thin and lightweight as the listing suggests which is always a plus when buying online. The picture also made it look like it was micro USB but it is USB C so that was a nice surprise. Overall great charger for the price.
","
Very good price compared to apple. So far it’s working fine, I wish it was a little better with my leather case though.
","
We have a Samsang S10+, S23 Ultra, iPhone 12 & 14 max pro, and a Google pixel 6a and none of them charge on this ""charger"". And all phones were removed from their cases...and still, nothing. Very disappointing.
","
Everything works exactly as you would think.  I simply plugged it in and it charges devices.  Great product.
","
I had an issue with charging my phone with my Lifeproof waterproof case on my phone. Customer service contacted me and resolved my issue. Thanks so much!
","
Really nice quality, no plastic. The only thing is that one of the lights on the side so poorly lit which make sit not balanced.
","
Slow charger, but I'm pleased with it since it charges through my plastic case, I only wish the lights would turn off, they're too bright in the night next to my bed. 2 stars off for that flaw in design.It's be if only the night could be turned off for night sleeping. It's too bright.
","
It takes a while to get it to charge your phone.  You have to place it just right on the charger to get it to charge.  Very frustrating.
","
Should come with adapter
","
I wasn't sure at first when I ordered it I heard that if you have a case on your phone it wouldn't work but that's not the experience I have it does work with a case and it works very well I would like to order another one could you send me a coupon code or a voucher or some kind of coupon cuz I will order a few more great Christmas presents or birthday presents or any kind of present
","
Bought this to charge my ear buds at work liked it so much I brought it home to charge my phone so I'm not struggling in the dark trying to plug in my phone.
","
It is great! Only issue I had had is my cat knocking my phone off completely or moving it just a smidge and it not being charged when I wake up. I don’t use for travel, I just use regular charger when traveling.
","
Bought this for my husbands phone. My phone has a wallet on the back so I can’t charge mine wirelessly. Took some getting use to finding the battery on the phone, but it works great. He even has a life proof case and it charges with the case on. We’ll definitely be buying more.
","
The device seems to work fine.  Charges my phone whenever I set it on the pad.  My gripe is with the light, and how it is always on.  The light is useful in that it changes color to indicate it is charging, so you know it's working.  However, the light never turns off, so if you plan to use this on your bedroom nightstand, find a different product.  I tried to cover the light emitting parts with black marker, but it looks bad and is only somewhat effective.  Aside from the annoyance of the light, I am concerned that it is constantly drawing electricity when not in use.
","
Seems to work well with my phone even with an otter box case on it!
","
This thing does not work at all my phone can sit directly on top of it and I will get absolutely nothing to make it even worse I custom built a table for this to fit tested it once before and it worked that time and then once I made all the cuts and put my time into it now it doesn't work even when my phone is out of the case directly on top of the charger it gets nothing
","
Without a headphone jack on the latest iPhones, it's been impossible to listen to anything through my wired headphones while charging. This allows me to get around that perfectly. Plus, it's effortless to charge my phone at night when I'm already half asleep and just want to roll into bed. Great product!
","
Easy to use, charges quickly, but I keep my phone on my nightstand at night and the charging lights on this are too bright and never go off.
","
I switch from sitting at my desk to being on-the-go numerous times during the day and this is the perfect accessory. Completely eliminates the need to plug in every time I sit back down. Pair this with a Quick Charge 3.0 charger and you'll be set!
","
Ordered 2 one for me and my boyfriend, his didn’t work at all and mine after a week is Working most of the time, I was sent a replacement and my boyfriend is happy, overall an okay product
","
Charges hood, perfect for my Tozo ear buds, but charges my note 10+ slower than my note10+ stock wall charger
","
Disappointing. First impression - the rose gold and white glass looks beautiful together. Its so thin and sleek! I actually bought 4 in different colors during the lightning deal ($9.99). This color was the nicest one. I also have a pop socket on my phone and i was concerned it wouldnt work but it still managed to charge. If you have a phone ring then it wont work. I suspect the metal ring causes an interference. Here's the bad - it charges very slow. It doesnt recognize super fast charging or even fast charging so it takes 3x longer to charge. It also gets really hot while charging. Im not looking to ruin my battery life so im going to return them all and stick to a cable.
","
I’ve had this product for a week. The first couple days it worked pretty good but it’s slowly charging less. Just last night I put it on charge at a little under 10% and woke up this morning (8 hours or so) to my phone at 43%. The charge doesn’t hold either. I’ve been on my phone for half an hour and it’s down to 35%. This is my first wireless charger and I love that I can reach over and conveniently grab it in the mornings but it’s not doing it’s job!!
","
I received this for charging headphones. Now I'll use it for all devices capable of charging without plugging in the type C cable. Well worth buying.
","
I charged multiple phones on it and they all worked the same, slow
","
The Tozo wireless charger is awesome. I've owned a few wireless chargers but none are built as well or function better than the Tozo. It's not plastic it's aluminum, they charge my phone fast and I love the lights 9n the top that help me position the phone on the charger at night. I also love the slim profile it looks beautiful on my night stand and the different color options.  I definitely will recommend this to my friends and family.
","
Great product and sleek looking. Would have been great if it included a wall charger in addition to cord and platform.
","

 Lights turn blue when phone is charging. I wish it will charge faster
","
Works great. Stays where you put it. Looks slick. LEDs indicate what the charger is doing.My one complaint is that the top is plastic. Considering the rest of it is machined aluminum, they should have just used glass for the top.
","
This wireless charger is great for small places and on the go. I love that there isn't a big light (to let you know if it is charging or not). I am very sensitive to light at night and this doesn't give off any major brightness. I would totally recommend this!
","
I think wireless chargers pretty much do the same thing although some are faster than others.  This TOZO was so satisfactory for me, I bought another one.
","
I love this little product it charges my earbuds quickly. The product is flat enough to stay out of your way and easy to read to tell when your phone etc is charging properly.
","
I’ve ordered four of these, sent two to my son.  It’s so nice not to have to plug and unplug phone for charging.  Very easy to use. My neighbor saw mine and ordered two for herself.  Customer service is outstanding.
","
I take this charger to work, or when I travel. It’s easy to pack & to set up to use.Dr. Gracia
","
Love it. My daughter had a wireless charger I used on a trip to her house. This one is even faster at charging and much nicer as it is not too bright in my bedroom. Like that it changes from green to blue when it is charging my phone. She recently came for a visit and prefers mine to hers as well. Went home with the one from my guest room in her suitcase. With my permission of course.
","
It’s ok cute but takes a while to charge my phone
","
I primarily use this to charge my AirPod pros. Works well. Takes up small space. Like the blue light to tell you it is charging.
","
So easy to charge our phones.  Just set it down on the flat charger.Probably buy a few to set up in other rooms in our house.  Won’t be without thisvery handy device ever again…..
","
It is only for Tozo wifi earbuds, will not charge other wifi devices
","
This products is so easy to use and gets the job done. No more chortling charger cords here! Love it!
","
This thing is beautiful.  I truly admire great designs in everyday objects, and this one fits the bill.  It's sleek, modern and unobtrusive all at once.  Plus, it charges your phone wirelessly (obviously; it IS a wireless charger after all).  Functional and great to look at.  What could be better?
","
I got this charging bad for myself, my boyfriend, my sister and daughter for Christmas and mine cracked?! It charges good but quality?! Cheap? I guess you get what you pay for.. I pray the others do not crack! I’m disappointed.. I would’ve given it 5 stars if mine didn’t crack so easy. I’ve kept it high and just place my phone on it..
","
There are two green lines on the side of the circle.  When your phone is laying perfectly on the charging surface, the color turns to blue.  Shortly thereafter, the blue lines flash on and off.  It puts out A LOT of light and the flashing light is very distracting.  Forget trying to sleep through it.  Once it is fully charged, the lines go back to solid green.  However, on more than one occasion I placed it on the surface and the lines turned blue.  However, the next morning, the phone was not charged.  I guess you are supposed to keep checking it until it actually is flashing and know it is actually charging.  I have replaced it.
","
The witch craft behind this non direct current device is mind blowing. It charges, but it’s not connected…. I mean where the energy come from? Nothing has spawned from it so I’m not concerned… for now. RIP Topsy
","
Works with all my devices and the small light isn't a problem for sleeping in the bedroom
","
Very slow charging for near about 4 hours for small devices
","
Bought it for my wife because she needs something easy and it looks really good. She is proud of it and shows it to her friends.
","
Great packaging, product is slim and sheik, fast charging. Easy to hook up. I have a Samsung S10e, it also charges IPhone's if they are equipped. I love it! I purchased 3- one for my bedroom, kitchen and 1 for my sons birthday. Great product. Try it, You'll love them. Thank you Tozo. A happy client
","
I like that it is compact. i thought i would like it more than i do because i still use my phone when cabled and do not have to put it on the pad and not use.
","
Good, slim, colors are great.could have an option to keep light off, but the light is fine enough.the charge is very quick.
","
I thought this was great when I first used it but then noticed that it doesn’t always fully charged phone. I put my phone on it last night at 35% and when I woke up this morning my phone was not at 100%.
","
Arrival was super quick.Just opened it so unsure of how quick charging is.Looks nice very slim design

I’ve had this product less than a month. It was a wonderful thing to have on my desk during zoom classes, however, the charge is slow. Still I liked it until this morning it refused to charge. My phone is at 64% and it refuses to charge
","
I needed a new charger for my office. It works great, it’s very thin and has chartered my iPhone even with a fairly heavy case on. I don’t find the light distracting at all as only a faint glow or pulse depending on charging mode.
","
This charger is ultra awesome. So thin and light and easy to carry in my purse or accessory bag. It’s very convenient to be able to just put my phone down and let it quick charge anywhere. This works even better with a rapid charger plug (not included) which I also sourced on Amazon easily.
","
Love the build quality and small footprint! Fast charges my galaxy s10+ with no problem.  Love this product!
","
it is small and light weight for traveling. charges my phone efficiently
","
Exceeded my expectations! Does what it what it’s supposed to and looks good doing it. Love the this profile.=========================Still charges just fine!! But if you prefer a dark bedroom at night, this isn't the right product. The lights on the side that indicate charging/charged are simply too bright. I've relegated this one to another room and had to acquire another charger for the nightstand.
","
I've been using this every day with no problems. Charges my phone and ear buds nicely. Surprisingly nice not having to plug things in all the time, just place my phone on it as I get in bed and grab it in the morning. Highly recommend.
","
Great product! TOZO stands behind their product and provide a one year warranty with their items. The pad is capable of both normal and fast charging (requires fast charging wall or usb plug) and it really is a great alternative to connecting and disconnecting your regular charger to the phone.You don't have to worry about the LED's brightness at night, I use it right next to my bed when I go to sleep and the light has never bothered me.
","
Would have given it 5 stars only that it does not charge LG stylo 5 phones
","
I really like this! As soon as I got it my phone needed charging, I plugged it in and within 20 minutes it was full, I also did not have to take my otter box cover off it made a perfect connection. I am planning on buying two more for gifts.
","
Very thin and works well. I had bought a belkin at costco for twice as much but it wouldn't charge my google pixel 5 fully. The TOZO charges my phone to 100% and the leds go from blue to green to indicate a full charge.
","
The charger works fine as expected.  It's light and easy to travel with.  My only complaints are (1) the bright LEDs don't turn off after a delay making it not so great for sleeping and (2) you have to be fairly precise when placing the phone on it to get it to charge correctly.
","
This thin disk works perfectly!  It changes both my iPhones and EarPod Pro just as I would hope (i just ordered the third wireless charger so I can have them all on at the same time).  Charger looks modern and solid.  No idea how fast it is, I leave the phone(s) on it overnight.  The lack of a wall plug adapter was no problem for me, I have a drawer full of them.
","
I had problems with the device but the customer service was excellent and they solve my problem immediately. Would recommend.
","
This is an amazing wireless charger. Its very well built and shocked me because it also has USB C. I didn't see that on the page but i may have overlooked it but great!  I dont have to carry another charger since my phone uses a USB C as well.  I can't say enough about this charger because its great and the materials that its made out of is amazing. I would definitely recommend this charger.
","
Very nice wireless charger easy to set up connects to phone with out a problem with a case on it small enough to travel with hassle free but big enough to sit phone on it without the phone having off the sides too much! Love those charger.
","
Surprisingly good charger. I honestly wasn't expecting much for the price but it's proven me wrong. Easy to use, looks and feels awesome, and when powered by my lighting charger it charges just as fast as if I'd plugged the cable directly to my phone. ""Galaxy S21 ultra""
","
Very solid build quality, and looks super sleek! The led is very thin, I was worried about it being too bright but it is just a small led and is easily completely covered by the iPhone while charging. I also love there isn’t a giant logo on it like the other options around this price range.
","
I like that it runs off usb c, which makes it easy to swap cable use. Its charging power is nice, and i especially like the color! Always important to have a pretty color to me atleast, and this one had plenty of options with a nice size factor
","
Very compact and very sturdy. Works very well with my iPhone. Smaller than the standard charging pads makes it easy to take to work with me. It says it is 15 watts, this of course depends on the power source you plug it into. So far, so good. I'm enjoying it!!
","
Love this wireless charging pad, just set it and forget it. I love that it lights up green to let you know it’s ready to go and then the light strip changes to blue when a device is charging. Works super well on my phone even with my bulky wallet case on. Make sure your phone is capable of wireless charging before purchasing! My fiancé’s phone won’t work with this because his phone is too old. Overall a great buy!
","
Trash. Didn't come with charger cord or charger box. I didn't mind that... I used my own. I even looked up to see if it supported my phone... still didn't charge my phone and I had to look up the manual to understand the device. ""Use original cord"" how am I to do that when it didn't come with 1.
","
It is very nice, works exactly as I had hoped. It only does fast charging if you have a special wall plug, which is my only criticism. It looks good and works fine.
","
As again TOZO has outdid their competition by providing higher or matched technical performance with excellent industrial design. I am using this one for charging my TOZO wireless earbuds. I was also able to use it for my Samsung S10+ charging as well as my wife's iphone without any constraints.
","
the issue of having it in your car is you have to find a way to secure your phone to the mount. I used rubber bands, but it is also sketchy since your case has to be off for it to chargeMore importantly, after about 2months it wasn't as easily responsive to charging. I assume it's an issue with a cable or port, it would sometimes flash light blue and not charge (or wouldn't sense the phone on it at all) the last week (bought mid October) I spend at least 5 minutes trying to get it in the perfect position with different weight balances for it to charge. if this is a long-term solution for you, spend a bit more money on a more reliable one.
","
irstly, the packaging of the box isn’t looking very cheap. Secondly, it came with every you needed but I wish the USB wire is longer or give us an option of the length when purchase. Thirdly, the plate is pretty thin and light weight and look durable. Forth, the LED light are so cool but I wish there are more colors shift.I really love their product overall. I am also using their phone case and screen protector.
","
I love this wireless charging pad. It is so classy looking, so sleek and perfect. I love the ultra-low profile. The cord it came with is a good length, not too short (it's so annoying when they are too short). The packaging is really well designed and professional-looking, so as a gift, this will look really good. Charges my T6 wireless earbuds like a dream.
","
This is a great wireless charger. My last charger was small and I had to place my phone just perfectly on the thing to get it to charge. This one is bigger, but not too big and very thin, and allows me to place my phone on it without worrying if it’s in “the right spot.” I did not get the adapter for the fast charge mode, but it works well as is. Overall it looks good and performs well.
","
This is a very sleek and fast charging unit.  The construction is minimalist and elegant.  Even through the case on my phone, it appears to charge nearly as fast as the cable.  It is also more forgiving in device placement than another wireless charger I own.  Can't fault it in any way, an excellent charger.
","
Well I have ordered 2 , one of them was defective they sent a replacement the very next day and that one worked , I just wish it have a turn off and turn on button instead of plugging and unplugging which is a big turn off for me , but otherwise for the price I will make the best of it
","
I had another charger that was pricer but not work as well as this one. Charges my phone quickly.

 I’ve never purchased a wireless charger but this thing is amazing it charges my iPhone 8 Plus super fast and it very easy to use. This is also super convenient for traveling it’s super small and thin. Fits anywhere!
","
I like the low profile of this wireless charger. Works great!
","
Just opened and seems like a quality charger.  Very thin which is nice.  Plugged in and it was charging my phone like it should. Also comes with a type-c charging cord for it which is nice.  The thin size is nice for traveling also.
","
It would be convenient- if after using I did not notice my iphone pro 11 max battery no longer lasts all day. This did not happen before. So l am going to see if my note 8 does better with this charger. I hope it doesn't drain that battery too.
","
Very high quality finished. I have iPhone XS, and it is compatible. I bought it to put on my desk at work, because I always need to grab the phone and go to meetings, this wireless charging pad makes this switch much easier. I have already broke too many of the wire chargers because of the rush. The green light bars on the charging pad will change to blue when the phone is in charge. It also comes with a 1 year warranty in the box, make sure to look into it.
","
Overall it is a really good wireless charger. The only issue is it will randomly not respond to being plugged in. You can take it in and out of the outlet with no luck.... you have to unplug the charging station from the connector for it to power back up and work.
","
It literally takes the whole night to charge my iPhone 11. Ridiculous. Do not recommend.
","
Tozo's wireless charger is a great addition to Tozo products I already use.It is an ultra thin charging pad, with a beautiful glast top looking finish, so it will fit anywhere, and it looks great!It is a MUST addition for anybody who has any of the Tozo headphones, or any other wireless charging device.
","
Power is sufficient.
","
It's a lot thinner than I thought it would be. It looks and feels like high quality material, and even works through the case on my phone.
","
Sticks to your table and turns blue when charging. It actually charges through your case and pop socket!
","
I got this specifically because of the range from the coils advertised. I’m able to have this mounted under the side table top and still charges my phone when I set it down.
","
It works great and I'm grateful that Amazon worked with me on the shipping and they were very gracious about it.  Good job Amazon!
","
This is thin and inexpensive. I have my phone just sitting beside me most times. My wireless earbuds sit quietly beside me. Why cannot they always be charged? When I lay them down I lay them on this and they are always charged and ready to go!
","
Gonna but more Bc my kid loves it so much he took it from me!! ! Love this purchase and keeping a lock on it!!
","
The charger has worked great for me. The top plate is made of an acrylic, so it will scratch over time, but for $20, I'm not expecting glass. The charger does indeed have over current/short circuit protection built into the IP6808 wireless charging IC.  One of the thumbnails claims over 98% efficiency, and this is just false and not possible with wireless charging.It does seem to be designed well, overall. For the price I would definitely recommend it.
","
Absolutely beautiful and stunningly convenient and powerful wireless charger. It is extremely easy to use, got a very sleek design and flawless performance. Ordered one, tested and ordered a bunch for my friends. This thing is a blast.
","
I tried 3 different phones, 2 different power ports. The led indicator came on and started blinking when phones were placed on it but would not charge.
","
I open it up and tried all of my devices that will charge on wireless charger and all of them worked.  Nice and small so good for travel but when Covid-19 is over take it to my office and put on the desk will not take up any space
","
While the item took a little longer than expected to arrive (Amazon told me it was lost), I was impressed once it arrived. The quality of the material is really good, it charges nicely and the LED lights let me know when it is working properly. I would buy this again.
","
Having an older IPhone and the charging port seems worn, I can lay my IPhone on this flat charger and it works amazing.
","
I am really impressed with the quality of this product. It is thin, sturdy, and aesthetically pleasing. It is very easy to use and works through my phone case. It charges pretty quickly too. Overall, this product is definitely worth the money, in my opinion!
","
Only thing I don’t like is if you don’t have your phone in the right position, it doesn’t charge, luckily the light turns from green to blue so you know if it’s charging or not.
","
I purchased the TOZO wireless charge to use with my new TOZO wireless earbuds. Since this was my first wireless charger, I wondered how well it would work. However, it was very easy to use and my earbuds recharged quickly. The charger is well made and looks good on my desk. I have not yet used it for travel, but since it takes up almost no space, it will be pack easily for any trips. I would certainly buy it again.
","
This works through my iPhone case, seems to work well. It’s for my desk. I’m satisfied.
","
Charges my phone quickly and easily.
","
Yes and know. I wish the pod didn’t always have to be connected. Wireless on the phone but not wireless still.
","
Too notch! This charger is the best you can get for the price. Feels like real quality and looks really sharp as well as it's super thin. I would most definitely buy another. Wireless charging is just so convenient. I keep one at my desk and one on my night stand. So far I have no complaints. And they come in a bunch of colors!!
","
This is a nice little charger that is not too expensive but appears very well-built. It has a small LED that changes from green to blue when charging but doesn't have an obtrusive glow at night so it's great for the night stand. I have a thick magnetic wallet case and it charges through the case with the jacket on with no problems. I haven't had it very long but so far I'm very happy I tried this wireless charger.
","
This thing is as easy as it comes. Plug it in and put your phone in the middle. The lights are green to let you know its ready to charge and turns blue when charging. That's it. Works great and sets up in seconds from my computer or wall charger.Great purchase!!
","
It’s extra flat and sleek looking. It has lighted stripes which change from green to blue when charging. I like this charger a lot.
","
I used this item to charge my iPhone and it didn't charge the phone at all.  I was quite disappointed.
","
I bought this to replace a different wireless charger I'd bought from Amazon a while back that didn't work very well. I'm very pleased with this product. It's super sleek and looks great. Sets up really quickly. My old charger, I had to fumble around to make sure the phone was positioned right, but this one has a glow that changes colors to let you know that it's charging, and it's much easier to find than my last one. It's worth the money.
","
Works well enough but watch out for other Tozo products, I bought T6 headphones I can't leave a (negative) review for due to 'excessive activity' they're only taking reviews from verified purchasers...when I try to leave a review from my order page...
","
That this charger works with Samsung and also I phones. Old and new.
","
So far, so good! This is a beautiful charger that has attractive indicator lights to let you know your phone is connected properly and when it is done charging at a glance. So far, I've had no issues with fast charging or connection. Solid purchase!
","
Just unpacked it and I’m already really impressed. Wasn’t expecting much because of the price, but it charges my phone pretty fast and I can leave my plastic protective case on. I’ll update my review if anything changes, but so far, I’m really impressed
","
I never had a charging pad before and I really like the ease of just laying my earphones on the pad (in their charging/protection case of course) and they are charged when I pick them up. It’s wonderful not to have to sort through charging wires for the correct connector all the time.
","
pros: great and thin, goes great on the corner of my desk, it goes great with my setup, awesome price, easy to use.cons: the cable is a bit short but it is usb-c so it is easy to replace since everyone has a spare usb-c cable.
","
Product as described, quality build and slim
","
This wireless charger is compact and attractive. It doesn’t take up much space and would be good for travel.  There are two narrow arcs of light that proved a guide for placing your phone on the charger. There are no additional light indicators that could possibly keep you up at night. I purchased both the gold and black version and like the look of both.I would purchase this again. It would make a great gift for the holiday!
","
This is a great product! The color changes when it is charging so I know that it's actually getting power to the device. It charges my small wireless earbud great, so when I go to school in the morning they are already fully charged. It is very easy to use and not complicated at all, I also really like the design! It's not big and bulky like other wireless charger so it looks really nice. Overall, would recommend
","
It is slow to charge the phone but is super easy to use.
","
This is the best wireless charger on the marketVery fast when charging and the lights are an extra they help to make sure the phone is charging and there not brite at all very soft i would recommend this charger Update the customer service is not help fill that offer u a free item when u buy this charger but never send anything and that do not answer any emails
","
Great charger, clean lines and appears to be of good quality.I like how the thin LED lights on the top stay illuminated (but not too bright). It makes it easy to place my phone on the charger in low light situations.
","
Cute design. Really wanted to love this product, but unfortunately I could only charge my phone without a case on it.
","
I wasn't sure if I would like a wireless charger but after I received it, I fell in love. It's super easy to set up/use and it charges my phone very quickly. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with an iPhone that is looking for a sleek charger.
","
Great charger and great products from Tozo. I also have a pair of wireless earbuds that work on the charger that I really like. Even better is that they have great customer service if there is any issue. Quick response and resolve.
","
Looks good, nice charger
","
I thought the charger was wireless but you pretty much have to charge the charger as your charging your phone. The charger is super cute but I wish the charger itself was wireless.
",,"
Worked perfectly fast charging my pixel 5!  Doesn't get hot and looks great on my nightstand. LED lights make it easy to verify phone is charging correctly.
","
I haven't used it yet. Looking forward to easy re-charging.
","
I love this charger, it works perfectly period I have different cases and it works and thick cases and in cases. It’s a quick charge.  High quality, super reliable, my go to charger.  It’s amazing, it looks futuristic!! It works better than my plug-in charger. I  highly recommend!
","
This wireless charger is a lot skinnier than many of the other chargers I've seen which is great when it's sitting out in the kitchen and no one even notices it's there. So far I have not had any issues with it and it charges perfects.
","
The delivery was super fast and charged my ear phones up right away. I am really stating to like this name brand.
","
It looks very elegant, functions thru my case with a pop socket - would recommend to others!
","
This was so simple to use right out of the box and it charges so fast and so far no issues at all. This was well worth the money so I don’t have to hunt for the cords to plug it in to the right charger.
","
The charger arrived one day ahead of schedule the delivery date. Device was packaged very well and was in perfect condition. Device works perfectly.The wireless charger is very nice looking. Very thin but has rubber strips on the underside so it is very stable and does not slide around.
","
I purchased this charger to charge his TOZO wireless earbuds and it works great. My son loves the convenience to charge both the earbuds and his iPhone 11. The quality of the earbuds from TOZO are what made me decide to get this charger. Very pleased!
","
exactly like described, very easy to use, just plug it in and all set. I have a thick phone case and a small metal plate stick on the back of the case for magnetic air vent holder, but it still work. How cool it's. Anything, which have wireless charge can be changed with this guy. I love it so much. Very satisfied, highly recommend.
","
This is a great charger. Charges the phone fast and I like the ability to be able to have the charger stick to the back of the phone while in use or being able to place it on the charger at night and not worry about it falling off and not charging.
","
This is very attractive and seems to work well. I got a QuickCharge power adapter to speed it up, and my phone (and S8) says that it's ""fast wireless charging,"" but the actual speed is still a lot slower than a wired charge. The phone is at 60% and it says it'll take 1hr 12 min to charge, but if I plug it in, it's only 50 minutes. Obviously this isn't the fault of the charger. I guess it's just a limitation of the technology that I wasn't aware of.I also wasn't aware until I got the package that you can't have any metal on your phone when using this. It does say that in the description - I just didn't read carefully enough. I use a magnetic car mount and had a metal plate stuck on the back of the phone. I just removed it and will put it inside the phone case from now on.UPDATE: This now consistently overheats my phone and I'm not willing to take the risk of my house burning down, so it's going back.
","
It works exactly as described! I wish the spot that it charged from wasn't so small in comparison to the actual disk size, but it still works.
","
Very nice wireless charger. I did not expect the material quality to be so nice. It's has a glass top and aluminum bottom and everything feels really nice. It charges my Galaxy Note 9 through it's case with no problem at all.
","
Im not sure yet
","
Great product, very easy to use and install. Although I’ve read some reviews about slow charging overtime, which I can stand behind, it will still give you a full charge overnight which I see this as an absolute win (for my avengers fans out there.. lol). Anyways.. buy it, it’s inexpensive and it won’t let you down. Cheers.
","
Excellent wireless charger.  I've had zero issues with it.  I have a pretty thick case for my phone and it still charges great.  I'm using it with my Samsung Galaxy s20 fe.
","
Bought this for my son it matched his phone. Charges fast and is easy to use and take on the go! He is happy with it only complaint is the blue is on the bottom the top is silver but that’s okay.
","
Got 3 of these for my husband and kids for Christmas! They are stinkin AWESOME. Super thin, they light up... and the price absolutely fantastic!! They even charge my husband's phone with his otterbox case on amd we got this brand of Bluetooth headphones which they also charge really well.
","
This wireless charger not only looks sleek and elegant but works great too!! My Samsung charger which was 5 years old would work intermittent and wasn't dependable.  This unit restores my fast charging capabilities and I can't recommend it enough!!
","
good value
","
Overall not bad...I love that it comes in so many colors
","
Love the clean and slick design of this charger. It is lightweight and very portable, so easy for travel.I like the LED lights indicator. I don’t sleep in the pitch dark, so they don’t bother me at all at night. Charging is about as fast as the usual wire chargers, which I don’t mind as I’ve heard speed charging could reduce your battery’s longevity over time.Wish cord was a bit longer, but it’s not something I can’t work with.
","
Works great but I wish the cord were a foot longer
","
Compact easy for travel. Cable is included. Charge is slower then expected but I use a thick Otter box. Purchased other products from this company ( 2 pairs of earbuds) and happy with quality of products.
","
This has a clean look which I love. It charges my ear buds super easy but I can’t get the phone to sit flat enough or straight on to get to to stay charging.
","
Very nice product at any price!
","
I love this think. It’s so skinny/sleek and fits great in any room. I love how it changes colors when it’s charging so you know it’s properly charging. Ended up buying one for each room. Great product
","
These are very comfortable, & the sound is exceptional!
","
I have a case as well as a popsocket on my IPhone 11. I have no issues charging with them on. My popsocket is placed on the center of my phone, directly touching the charging surface. I bought 3 of these initially, and will buy more for additional rooms of my house.
","
Charge my IPhone and earbuds. Charger works well.
","
I liked the look and slim feel of the product. There seemed to have been a minor issue with mine and they sent me a new one which was absolutely great of them to do. I love the companies great support and will definately use them again.
","
It is small and easy to use. It charges the phone quickly like it is supposed to. Also, I like the sleek design and lights that show when the charger is on and when the phone is positioned properly onto it. The lights are nice, but not distracting in the dark when trying to sleep.
","
Works Great. A cable connector should be included.
","
Awesome alternative to Apple MagSafe. It does the job but at half the price. 1-year warranty included with purchase.
","
Phone has to be on it just right. If your case is too thick it will not work. Overall okay.
","
Love the color all black and looks exactly like what it shows in the picture and really works with my iPhone. Really recommend you guys to get it if the regular charger isn’t charging because of either too much lint in the port or it just doesn’t want to charge
","
Looks modern and easy to use. Love the blinking light when item can't be charged with this item. As in will not charge Pixel 4a 5g (which I have). Does charge Pixwl 3XL and other phones that family members have, which is nice when they visit. Will keep due to this feature, yet disappointed that it does charge my phone.
","
Not sure if anyone else is impacted but I get an error that it's not compatible for fast charging with my Samsung s20 phone.  Read reviews Samsung's latest update may not allow uncertified devices to fast charge.  Either way this product although it says it supports a Galaxy s20, that no longer appears to be the case.  I get an error every time I put my phone on it that it has to charge at slower speed.
","
FYI Does not charge with or without case IPhone 12 PRo Max unless you update your iPhone to the latest update
","
Very disappointed.  They make this ad look like this is a substitute for the official MagSafe charger.  It's not.  Not only does it not have any kind of visual indicator of charging (neither does the MagSafe) but the magnets are significantly weaker than a real MagSafe charger, and so this barley works at all through any kind of case, including a MagSafe rated case..  However the big disappointment is whale a real MagSafe charger will deliver a little over 15W of power to the device, this charger is unable to exceed 8.  So while it MIGHT be a 15W charger, it is NOT a 15W charger for an Iphone 12.  Seems like they very deliberately left that detail out of the product description.  Mine are going back as defective.
","
This charging pad is very thin and convenient. I charge my wireless earbuds and my phone on it with no issues. The 10w charging option is good for most phones but it can take a while longer if you have a huge battery.
","
Great product. Charges quickly with USB-C wall block. The magnetic hold is really strong if using with MagSafe. I will use this at home, but it would be great for traveling. *Note* If mag safe doesn’t work correctly try removing your cover. Some covers aren’t made to work with MagSafe.
","
If you are looking for something as a last resort… then this charger is for you! As for me? I definitely need to find another with more power. Be sure to do your research!
","
I bought this wireless charger with high expecting based on their T10 ear bud performance and I was not disappointed. Simple set up works with all.of my wireless capable charging items. I'll be bringing this on business trips too. It will cut down on all this cords for sure.
","
I have only had this charger for a few days, but I can not say a bad thing about it. It is super thin and light, yet is still sturdy and is wrest quality. It charges my phone quicker than a traditional iPhone cord does. It has a sleek look and it is easy to tell it is charging by the changing color lights on the top. It is a great charger. I will definitely be ordering more in the future!
","
It does exactly what it is designed to do, I pair it with my fast charger wall plug to get a faster charge.
","
Well, I had high hopes. It’s very true to color and size. It does charge my iPhone, but at a snail’s pace. It took 30 minutes to charge less than 10%. DONT waste your time
","
It seems to interact with a metal desktop in a way that makes it glitch out. Sometimes it won't accept a device to charge and you have to unplug/replug it. I suppose that's a function of how slim it is, but it'd be nicer if they worked out what's causing it because it _does_ charge just fine most of the time.
","
From an aesthetic perspective, one of the best (if not best) looking wireless chargers I’ve seen. Has a nice subtle look, but also well made. This is my first wireless charger and I’m impressed! It does come with a USB to USB-C cord, which is nice.
","
Amazingly easy to use; beautiful colors and makes for a sleek addition to my electronic charging station area; LED charging indicator lights are not super bright so having it on my nightstand is not distracting; impressed by the charging safety features.  Great product to purchase for yourself or as a gift.  Works amazingly well with all my wireless charging devices.
","
Great product overall worth the money in my opinion and easy to use. I had a bad habit about using phone at night so I would just leave it on here and I have a better sleeping schedule because of it.
","
Wow! What an amazing little charging device! I love it! It’s so cute with my pink and white gaming setup! While in a game, I can sit my phone down and allow it to charge! It’s so useful and handy! I love it so much!
","
This product is cool. However it has this really annoying light that blinks while my phone is charging. I keep my phone on my nightstand at night and the blinking light was so annoying that I had to go back to using my old charger. I haven’t found that you can turn off the lights, if I could then the product would be perfect!
","
I was worried my phone case would be too thick to charge my I phone 11 pro but it is amazing
","
Quick working after roughly a month. Charges for 60 seconds then stops, the charges, then stops. Doesn’t consistently charge so it makes me nervous to use it when I have to be up by a certain time in the morning if it’s not going to charge my phone.
","
I've bought 2 of these and one was awesome. Works great. Looks good.  The other one I have had problems with. The customer service worked very hard to replace and make it right. Nice seeing a company so intent on customer satisfaction. Hope to deal with again. soon.

This charger is super sleek and looks really nice pretty much anywhere you put it. I was really surprised I could charge my phone through my case (it’s a case with a charger built in) but it doesn’t really have a problem with it.
","
This thing is great! I don't have to take off my case in order to charge my phone (that always drives me crazy). It's so thin, it fits anywhere you want for travel. It charged my Samsung Galaxy S20 in no time!
","
I purchased this for my husband’s birthday because he always forgets to plug in his phone. I set it on his nightstand so now he can just easily place his phone there every night and not worry about having to connect his phone to a power source! It’s super chic, quickly charges, and I even love the little light which now we use as a nightlight in our bedroom. (It’s the perfect amount of light! Not too bright!)
","
Wireless charging indeed. I didn’t even know my phone had an option to charge wirelessly. This charger works well and looks modern.  I just let it sit on the kitchen island. Whenever I need a little juice I just plop the phone on the circle and presto! My battery charges. The
","
What’s not to like…this is such a good alternative to the regular MagSafe charger and it comes in black. If you are not looking for getting another Apple accessory and want something that’s just as good, you can’t pass this one up!
","
Tried everything but the thing just lights up and that’s all it did , tried a couple different things different phones and different wires and adapters, I really didn’t know what to do and decided to just send it back and get a different one
","
The charger puck seems sleek and minimalistic and my iPhone XS seems to charge ok.
","
The product is a good alternate for my fast charging charger, though it does charge at a slower pace.
","
Looks nice on my nightstand and works great. easy to tell when I don't have my phone on the right spot for charging and if the led's bother you you can turn your phone to cover them.
","
Works well, inexpensive, attractive style.Nice warranty. Charges my galaxy phone and new Tozo 10 wireless headphones. However, my wife's galaxy doesn't charge as well. (Maybe her style of protective case)Also it won't charge my Galaxy watch?All in all, happy with the purchase!
","
Not a fast charger but good for overnight charging. Works well with magsafe cases and is light and compact. Only other downside is the length of the cable.
","
Beautiful product, ultra slim, compact, easy to pack, high quality finish, fast charging are a few thoughts, that come to mind about this charger. I wanted something that was aesthetically pleasing and practical to charge my iPhone XS MAX and this fit the bill. Being that I was familiar and satisfied with my other TOZO purchases it was no brainer in making the decision to acquire the charger. Highly satisfied and recommend to anyone looking for a sleek and beautifully crafted product!
","
If the phone is not position exactly in the right spot it will not charge
","
Works well with all compatible devices, I haven’t had any issues with it so far. It’s smaller than most wireless chargers which is nice but if you have a large device that you want to charge it may be an issue.
","
AWESOME! Perfect for night stands and desks, not to bright in a dark room! Charges my iPhone 12 with and without a case. It comes with its own cable to plug in (no outlet plug in)Super super super handy!!
","
I have two of these, one at work and one in my bedroom. The one at work is finicky and I have to move the phone around a lot sometimes to get it charging. The one in my bedroom is fine but the lights on the charging pad are BRIGHT. Just a heads up.
","
This is my first wireless charger, and I wanted something to test it out. To be honest, this exceeded my expectations, and gave me charge speeds relatively similar to my direct corded charger. My only complaint is that you need to be sure that the phone is placed directly in the ""charging zone"" for it to work, and occasionally I'll be just a half inch off and my phone won't be charged. That said, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase, and found it to be great value for the money spent.
","
This charge is hit or miss... i swear. I have this charger set up on my nightstand right next to my bed.  So when I go to bed, I charge my phone on this thing.  First off, you CANNOT CHARGE THIS IF IT HAS A POP-SOCKET ON IT.  I do have a pop-socket on my phone, so I need to remove my phone case which has the pop-socket on it every night when I charge my phone.  That is one big annoyance.  Secondly, the charging is hit or miss.  I've been using this thing for a few months and SEVERAL mornings I wake up and see that my phone DID NOT CHARGE AT ALL OVERNIGHT while the phone W/O a  case was SITTING ON THE CHARGER........... EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.  Usually I only charge my phone at night while sleeping, so when it is not charged in the morning....  Maybe other wireless chargers are better, I do not know because I will not be buying anymore after this crappy experiance
","
It's cute and sleek I love the color . Charge is kinda slow
","
Got this thinking about a way of having a wireless charger at my desk with a small, discreet footprint. No brands on top of it, very thin and premium look. I was afraid the LEDs lights would be too bright by they aren't, my main use is to charge wireless airbuds, but I was suprised about how fast it charges my wife's iPhone X, with an Apple power brick.
","
I needed one of these at work and this fit the bill. It’s slim and compact. It worked straight out of the box; plugged it in and started charging. I like the magnet concept, but I have a case on my phone and it won’t work through that. Great product!
","
Like it a lot but took in my bag and somehow it cracked in top
","
The product was exactly as described. It is thin and stylish. So far it is also working as described. The charger is thin enough to place in different places around the house where a quick charge might be needed -- like the kitchen and TV room.
","
This is one of my favorite chargers. While it doesn’t charge the fastest it is great for overnight charging. I charge my iPhone 11 and AirPods with this one and I also got my dad one. And the color options are amazing. I love the gold and white one.
","
I really like the chargers profile and easy of use - the contact area is quite large and starts charging without having to shift the phone. I have not, however, experienced any noticeable speed differences when using a QC 3.0 adapter vs a standard adapter. But, I still think this is a great lslim profile wireless charging option.
","
Very thin, slick and the quality looks good, packag well, nothing I don't like, just make sure your device is capable to do wireless charging.
","
Works great for the Pixel 5. The light is green when ready, blue while charging. It stays lit all night but points out the back so it's no bother at night.Charging is fast, but you need to wait a couple seconds for the Pixel 5 to change to the faster charge.
","
Works perfectly and charges my iPhone 11+ fast! The base lights up blue for charging and green when charged. Not a bright light, this is on my nightstand and doesn’t bother me at all at night. Great charger!
","
Looks good, fiddly placement to charge. Also doesn’t like anything nearby. Other makes were less susceptible to this.
","
This charger has plenty of power and is able to charge through even through thick plastic phone cases.  The charger quickly got the attention of the other family members in our house with the sweet looking LED lights.  Case is very thin and light weight, making it perfect for travel.  Overall very pleased with the charger.  Charger comes with a free one year warranty upgrade.
","
I don’t like the fact the light constantly stays on but other than that I’m happy with my purchase.
","
This little charger is so easy to use, charges up pretty quickly, and works as intended. It has an aesthetic, sleek design as well and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. Overall, I was pleased with this purchase and would purchase again.
","
Given as a gift
","
My first foray into wireless charging and I am glad I waited.  This wireless charger knows when to charge and not.  It works with my iPhone in the case and, as advertised, it only charges when the phone is placed on it.The slim design makes it perfect for travel and home.
","
This is my first time buying and using a wireless charger, and I love it so much. It automatically stops charging when at 100% or to prevent overheating. I love that its universal too, so that everyone is the family can use it instead of using separate chargers for each person
","
First I bought Tozo earbuds that survived going through the laundry.  So when I noticed TOZO while searching for a wireless charger for my phone, and given its low price point, it was an easy buy.  It works great.  No set up necessary...it just works.  Very thin and feels sturdy.
","
Works perfectly with my iPhone XR, my boyfriend’s Galaxy Note 9, and my sister’s Galaxy S10. Also charges my new TOZO earbuds. It’s nice to have universal charging throughout the house. I got the white for my office and the matte black for my living room. So much easier than plugging phones in.
","
Looks great. Well made. Works great.
","
This charger is beautiful. I bought it because I had bought earbuds that charged wirelessly- but i ended up returning the earbuds because they kept falling out; so i also returned this because I didn't have any other devices that would've charged wirelessly. If i ever get any devices I will definitely purchase again.
","
I just received this.  It is my first wireless charger.  I have tried it out and it works.  It is not as fast as when I plug a charging cable into my device, but it is more convenient than messing with cables.
","
This wireless charger is beautiful and super clean looking, I’ve been using it for a month now and it works great totally worth the price
","
Thicker than the advertised 5mm (about 5.3mm without the rubber feet and 6mm with) and it's super finicky about placement. Never once could I get a phone to start charging without playing around with it's placement for a bit. I saw the lights switch to blue like it detected the phone, but the phone wouldn't start charging without fiddling.
","
This little charger works just as it should. Starts charging my iPhone SE right when I place it on top. Charges quickly. The light on the front is subtle. I keep this next to my bed and it doesn’t bother me. Easy.
","
Fast delivery.  So easy to setup and use that did not need the instructions.  Charges fast.  I use it for my phone and my earbuds.  Great product.
","
I purchased this specifically to charge my earbuds case but it is also great to charge my phone when my tablet is plugged into the other charger.
","
The quality feels very good and it’s very light as well, very good for traveling. I really like how the light switches from green to blue when charging and then back to green when completely charged. Very pleased with this product.
","
It’s a nice wireless charger for the price. But it does charge kinda slow
","
This is easy to use and set up. This is very convenient for me since I pick up and set down my phone a lot when I’m at my desk. My only issue is that I had a pop socket on my case and had to switch to a different case that did not have a pop socket.
","
I recently purchased this item. No problems so far
","
The charger worked as advertised
","
It's a good product but doesn't work on my husband's note 10 and that's who it was for!
","
Did not work on anything multiple phone, earbuds it's a POS
","
This is the first wireless charger I've bought for my phone and I LOVE it! A lot of the other chargers were chunky, ugly looking chargers that I wasn't thrilled about—when I saw the white and gold version of this charger, I knew it would look beautiful in my home and how convenient it would make charging my phone—all of that has proved to be true! I also like the lights that tell me when my phone charging.
","
I love this charger. I placed it on my nightstand. When the phone isn’t charging, the charger looks just like a small white tray on the table. It is not an eyesore like the standard black chargers. It works great, I use it to charge my IPhone 11 Pro Max.
","
I have only used this a couple of days, but it seems to work well, and is much easier than charging with a wire plugged into the phone.  My phone is an iPhone SE2020, with a OtterBox Commuter case, and it works well with the case on.
","
Before buying this product I broke the charging port of my iPhone twice! My PHONE FELL OFF MY NIGHTSTAND AND THE LITTLE PIECE OF WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO THE CHARGING PORT BROKE INTO THE PHONE. I HAD TO PAY A BUNDLE TO GET IT FIXED. THIS PRODUCT SOLVES THAT PROBLEM FOR ME!!!! This product is great! Easy to understand and it started charging my phone immediately. I  recommend this product to everyone! Love it...REALLY! Nick
","
The design is decent and compact. Just unboxed it.
","
OK design is very simple but durable, I love the color I like that the top has a Rubber material to keep the phone from falling it’s the perfect size to not be in the way of anything charges my iPhone XS max with no issues.
","
Wireless charger looks great on my table. Love the colors. Charging is good but phone has to be placed properly.
","
Great charger but weird it doesn’t come with charger plug. Sold separately
","
Doesn't fully charge the phone and stopped working all together.
","
The only issue I ran into that if you have an OtterBox on your phone you have to jiggle it around on the charger to get a charge
","
You really have to make sure you place perfectly,  or it will not completely charge. You also must remove your case to charge, kind of inconvenient but I still like not having to use plug.
","
I bought two of these for the household. The aesthetic design is what sold me. Doesn’t look cheap - they are so beautifully made and sturdy! sometimes I do have to angle my phone right for the charging to start, but it fast charges my iphone 11 and the convenience of placing it on a surface vs using a usb charger is great. I’ll be gifting these to some of my friends. Thanks Tozo!
","
This is a great little gadget. It started charging my Iphone 12 right away, and I'm really happy. Just so people are aware, they offer a gift if you give them a 5 star review, but to me, I think it's worth 5 stars, so I'm fine with that.
","
This is a PHENOMENAL charger, especially for the price. The cord it comes with is slightly short (still reaches to a night stand/desk) but I’m used to my extra long charging cord. Charges my AirPods, iphone, Apple Watch, and iPad all without any issues and does so very quickly. Do yourself a favor, buy this now. Just add it to your cart and thank me later. 10/10 recommend.
","
Bueno
","
Product quality feels good, neat slim design.No issue charging my IPhone X.
","
Easy to set up, very little to do in terms of that. Just plug and play. Only complaint is that it charges a bit slowly but I guess thats fine.  My family all have a mix of USB C and  lightning chargers so this is universal to iphone and android so thats super nice and gets rid of twice as many cables.
",,"
When it works, it’s great. However, I’ve had to unplug and replug back almost daily for it to power on and charge my phone. It goes completely dead and only unplugging and replugging will allow it to charge. Wish this thing was reliable, very sleek looking and modern. Zero.Update: turns out I had a bad plug. Tried another one into same outlet and works like a charm!!Second update: it does a weird thing where the lights flash three or four times and won’t charge the phone unless you pick the phone up after the light flash and put it back on. Frustrating.
","
I just opened this up. Had my phone charging with original cable, checked how much time was left for a full charged, processed to move my phone to this wireless charger and estimated time was the same 🤯 I love this because I've tried others and the time isn't the same due to my phone being on a 3.0A fast charger. The only thing that worries me, would be that the cube I plugged it into is making a wierd noise. Overall I recommend 👌Update: the day after posting my review, the charger started charging super slow. What should take 1 and 20 mins to charge was gonna take 3hrs 11 mins. Really disappointed..
","
Very easy to use, not super bulky so good for traveling. Overall great product.
","
Está bien y carga bien
","
The cord won't stay plugged in to the charger so many many many times a day I have to replug it since my device is no longer charging.  It's extremely frustrating given the purpose of the item is to charge electronics.
","
Maybe I got a bad one but whenever I put the phone on the charger it turns blue and then after a minute or two it starts flashing green. And stops charging. It’s nice and slim so I think it would be great for travel but only if it will actually charge.
","
Great travel size and build quality. Comes with a good quality usb c cable, I was little afraid the cable will be cheap flimzy type. The charge surface is rubbery mat so the phone doesn't slip or anything which is a nice touch imo. I only minor gripe is that the led is a little small. Good purchase
","
Slick design, fast shipping but stop working in 2 days contacted customer service and immediately received response
","
This charger was fine the first two months, and then it starts to not charge my phone. Now it's like half of the time my phone is dead on the charger cuz it's not charging at all! Unbelievable, plus at this time I cannot return it anymore, so new customers beware! This will not be your option if you would like to get a durable one.
","
For the price this wireless charger is super cute and useful! It’s perfect for my airpods to get a fast charge. Will be updating in a month!
","
Great charger!Great customer serviceThis is an excellent wireless charger! It’s a clean, beautiful design. Very thin compared to other wireless chargers I’ve had and not as finicky about placement (doesn’t have to be completely centered). It has soft lights on the top and the bottom that are green when not in use and blue when charging, but they are very subtle and do not light up my whole room disturbing my sleep. Great value! Highly recommend
","
Charges iPhone 8 Plus and well.  My daughter loves the glossy white finish on her white vanity.  Great price.  Have had good luck with TOZO products and good customer service.  Came with charger and USB C to type A USB cable for easy plug into AC adapter.
","
The product shows green to indicate that it is on and afterwards charges things pretty well. Great for the price, plus it comes with a 1-year warranty, which is helpful for if I notice any errors with the product after using it for a while. Brought to use for my galaxy buds, and overall happy with the purchase!
","
This product works very well! It’s stylish and easy to carry with you when traveling due to its size. Charging power is not that fast, but that’s to be expected and it is in line with any other wireless charger.I have it my living room in case I or any of my guests want to charge their phones. Since it goes so well with the decor I just leave it plugged in the whole time.
","
I am pleasantly surprised with how well the item looks and the feel of the items (looks very well built).  I got two - one for my work desk, and one for when I travel.  Would recommend.
","
Good charging power and easy to use. Charges fast for my tozo earbubs. Great buy
","
Gets the job done, charging is not very fast, but leaving it for the night is perfect. Light is pretty bright for the night so you need to position the phone well to block the lights. For travelling I am a bit afraid how durable this is without any protection.

 This is an awesome charger! It is small and super easy to charge your phone. The magnet is great for when you need to pick up your phone it keeps charging. I would highly recommend this charger and it is a great price!
","
The charger is USB-C powered (which I don't have) but does come with a cable. It has nice accent lighting next to the charging pad. Works great with my AirPods 2nd Gen and I will likely buy from TOZO again.
","
This is a really great charger.  It charged my phone quickly; and I love that it’s wireless.  I can take it anywhere and simply place my phone on it while it’s plugged in to get a fully charged phone quickly.
","
Didn’t work with my Samsung phone.
","
The USB cord does not fit into properly into the charging base.  Used it for 2 days before it stopped.  It's so loose that it doesn't stay in or have contact.  A waste of money, don't buy this product.
","
A nice charger that does as advertised. Very modern design that looks great.
","
It works perfectly for the iPhone 10 and up. Light weight and charges the phone to its full capacity in approximately 20-25 mins. Definitely buy but only for iPhones. The look of it is sleek and fits just about anywhere perfectly.
","
I don’t know why it’s taken me so long to buy a wireless charger, but I’m so glad I did because of its convenience! It’s smaller than I expected, but that’s for the best because it takes up less space. Only downside is you can really only fit one product at a time on it. Super sleek and minimal design. Would buy again.
","
I thought this was a great charger when I received it.  It looked good and charged as expected--until it didn't.  Stopped working after two weeks.  I reviewed the troubleshooting video and after watching, I realized I was using the product as instructed.  I even tried it with my husband's phone.  Since it was originally working, I knew I was using it properly.  I was expecting to get it replaced without a hitch--wrong!  There is a form you need to complete with a dropdown list from which to choose your product, and the company requests that you upload your Amazon proof of purchase, as well as a photo with the logo showing.  Despite requesting two forms of proof of purchase, the website only allows you to upload one--even though both combined are within the MB limit stated on the form.  I figured I'd submit one at a time; however, once you hit the submit button, the dropdown list for the product you are requesting the warranty for unpopulates.  So no warranty, as there is no other way to contact the company.  I'd like a replacement, but I'm guessing that won't happen.
","
I recently purchased this for my husband who's charging port is messed up. I was worried I'd have to spend $100+ on purchasing another phone through the insurance since it was difficult getting to charge it. Thankfully I found this wireless charger and gave it a shot. There is literally nothing to it, you just plug it into the wall, lay your phone on top and get to charging. Definitely worth it and very affordable!
","
Very good item, perfect for traveling and easy to use.
","
It was a really good price and is easy to use.
","
I've used other wireless chargers that generated lots of heat, but not these.  The charging time is reasonably fast, but not the fastest I have seen.  But they get the job done and again, without a lot of heat - which is a big deal.
","
It's great I use it to charge my Galaxy note 10+ and my ear buds. I like how the light change color so you'll know when it's done charging. And it's easy to charge even with an otterbox on my phone and a case on my ear buds.
","
Very nice! This is so much nicer than the old version of these. It charges quickly, does not get too hot, and the lights on the base when the phone is on just right are perfect. I’ve used other wireless chargers where I thought I was charging my device and wasn’t really. Great deal, highly recommend!
","
I've had this charger for a few days now and I'm really happy with it! Looks great and charges my phone and wireless headphones very quickly. I'll definitely be getting more in the different colors for around the apartment. Also you can't beat the price.
","
Easy to use only problem is it won’t charge my phone with the phone case on
","
This is my first wireless charger, so I don’t have much to compare it to in terms of functionality and I only use it for overnight charging. That being said, my phone is always at 100% in the morning (even after a short night), and the slim profile and sleek appearance of the charger are great features.
","
Charger has nice weight to it and the quality seems really good. It charged my iPhone 12 mini with no problem. The charger also works really well with my apple case. Highly recommend to those who do not want to pay full price for the apple charger.
","
Very nice product overall. Top notch.
","
Glass surface makes this the perfect kitchen charger.  Occasional droplets or dirt are easily cleaned off.  Colored lights make it easy to see charging status from a distance.  Availability in various colors lets you find one to match your decor.  Reasonably priced, too.
","
Works great.  I have a Galaxy S7 and I didnt have to set make any changes on the phone to do wireless charging.  I literally plug in the charged, put my phone on the charger and to my surpise it started charging right away.
","
Bought it for my son, he said it charges fast. Satisfied customer.
","
This is a nice slim, lightweight charger. It is not the fastest charger but it stops charging when device is full. One thing I don’t like is that the light is always on even when your not using it.  I have my on my nightstand so the light sometimes bothers me in the middle of the night.
","
Purchased, just found out my phone doesn't have wireless capabilities.  Hope vender allows me to return it..
","
Product is very easy to setup and use. I haven't had to travel yet so I don't know how it is travel wise but I LOVE the look (I ordered two colors) and it charges my phone in a decent amount of time! Overall extremely satisfied!
","
These are great I have them on my desk and by my bed side so all I have to do is plopp it on there and let it charge. Charging speed has been great and they look good and presentable on a desk.
","
After one week it’s topped working. I would put my phone to charge at night and it will only charge about 10%
","
It definitely looks amazing and rich specially for the price point. Although it does not charge as fast as the apple original charger, it is sufficient enough for regular use. I am completely content with the product. It is very sleek and easy for travelling. Although this has never happened to me, I would be very happy if they provided some kind of sleeve for travelling to avoid scratches on the surface. (Just being too skeptical)
","
This is a well built product. It’s made out of glass and metal...not plastic or flimsy. Very thin and really stylish. I do wish i came with an actual charger (wall plug). But, most of us have those laying around, so not a big deal.
","
Updated: this stopped working after two years.  I have a few but one flat out died and the other two are kind of hanging on.  Good for short term.  I love the way this product looks.  It fits great on my nightstand and I am hoping it will last a while.  This does not charge Apple watches but it did charge my iPhone.
","
My husbands charging port on his iPhone 11 stopped working so we got this and it works like a charm! Just think it’s kinda slow. We bought two. One for home and the other for his job.
","
It charges great. Haven't had any issues.  Got it because my phone plug in wasn't charging my phone. Charges the phone no problem
","
I just got the charger yesterday, so I will update my review if anything changes. Charger looks great, and seems to work well. It charges my phone through the case easily. I had to move my magnet (for phone mount) and pop socket away from the middle of the phone, but since that was done it works great!
","
The charging station is very sleek and very low profile.  I like the design and material and it feels well made.  I haven't used it for traveling yet but I can imagine it would be very easy to travel with.  So far it's charged my my phone and earbuds easily and quickly.  I like the fact I can just lay my phone on it to charge rather than plug my phone in.
","
I have to move my phone around and around until the charger finds a connection. It isn't like those other ones where you can just set your phone on it and leave it. You have to make sure it's actually charging and nothing will bump into it
","
I saw this when seeking new ear buds and it was offered in the bundle. It arrived quickly, was beautifully packaged, is super thin and portable and charges both the buds and my iPhone very well! I had one before that was so bulky but this works great. Is gift this to someone as well. It’s perfect!!
","
I just got this charger yesterday. I already like I just lay it down and it charges. This is my first wireless charger. I have an otterbox defender case (I think, whichever one is the thick one), and it charges with the case on it. It’s a good one!
","
I tried 2 different phone types and it won't charge. I would return it but I through away the packaging. So I waisted money.
","
Good product so far
","
It looks really nice and sleek. Definitely great material, it doesn’t feel light or cheap. The light is a little bright for me, I think my clear phone case might exaggerate it a bit but I still love this charger. My boyfriend and I can use the same charger even though we have different brand of phones; no more searching for different charging cords! I definitely recommend this charger, not only for its functionality but it’s so pretty

 As wireless chargers go, this does the job. It's a little smaller than other one I had previously, which is nice. It charges my Samsung s9+ at about 6-7% every 10min, which is pretty fast for this type of charger. In my video, this charge pad is the one on the right.

Convenient, sleek, and easy to use! Charges more slowly than a cable

Works on Apple & AndroidPerfect

Super fast shipping, well packaged and easy to setup.One observation: I ordered and received W1 version however the charging indicator is similar to W6 (three ones that has green light indicator at the bottom), unsure if this is recent design change.
","
Just received.  So far so good. It works nice and sleek.
","
Great little additional charger, however it does not work with my otter box case on!
","
I am pleasantly surprised about this product! It is by far the most aesthetically pleasing wireless charger out there. I decided to order it because I was going to take my PopSocket off of my phone (typically does not charge with one on) and to my surprise it worked with it still on!! I have an iPhone X with a case and a popsocket on but it still charges all through that. Highly recommend this product!
","
Slim beautiful design but will not work if you have a metal plate on your phone for magnetic car holders.
","
This is now the 3rd charger we have bought (same one, different colors). I love how pretty this is and how it has a green light when it's not charging and turns blue when the phone is on and charging. it is pretty and functional! I won't be surprised if we get more.
","
I'll give it two stars because the aesthetics of this charger are lovely - it's minimalist and clean and looks great on my desk. However, it only worked for a few months. About 3 months of infrequent use, when placing my iPhone X on the pad, it would charge for a second, then stop for a second, then charge again for a second, then stop. It seemed my AirPods could successfully charge on the pad a bit longer, but now they don't seem to connect to the pad. Both my iPhone and AirPods successfully charge with charging pads from other brands. The aesthetics are not worth it for this charger - go elsewhere!

My wireless charger is beautiful to look at it’s easy to use easily connect it’s smooth and light weight and it gives you a little night late at night I really love this wireless charger I am glad that I purchased it

This company is making me write a review in order to receive the free one-year warranty. Overall, it’s a very decent product. You get what you pay for. Except, they should fire their graphic designer because their paperwork is littered with misspellings and incorrect grammar. My personal favorite is the “enjoy your 1 year hassle warranty.”
","
Charger port broken this was the cheapest and most efficient replacement short term.
","
This product is great— I keep it on my dresser and charge my phone every night. It never gets hot and charged quickly. It is slim and beautiful. There is nothing not to like — absolutely no complaints.
","
I bought it for my desk at work. This charger looks sleek and charges fast. Once one coworker saw it on my desk, she ordered it then a few more  coworkers followed suit.
","
Like the fact they charge earbud case as well
","
Got this mainly for charging my Pixel phone in the car and for traveling. Very slim, is not advertised as a fast charger but charged my phone from 60% to 100%  in less than 25 minutes.  Very solid feeling.
","
But at a fraction of the cost! Whoever is in charge of the packaging is doing an amazing job. The product is also an excellent product. I love it and will recommend to anyone who is looking for a wireless charger.
","
Slow charging and not compatible with all devices,  I have a Samsung galaxy and it works however not all Androids
","
Works well but very sensitive. If the phone or whatever you’re charging gets moved a little it will not charge.
","
I am very happy I purchased this item. I got the white/silver rim. LED is not too bright and does not keep me up at night while on my nightstand, green when phone is not on and blue while charging. I take it everywhere with me, I don't have to deal with cables anymore and not to mention getting them confused with who's cable is who's. It fits in my purse, It travels well and it's weightless.
","
I chose this wireless charging pad because it is slim and attractive, inexpensive and made by Tozo which has a reputation for well functioning electronics. It does not disappoint. I am using it for wireless AirPods. The white/silver blends well with my furniture and the pods. So far does not disappoint.
","
I was really hesitant to get one of these... but I love it! It works very well and it's really convenient. I put it next to where I usually sit so I anytime I put my phone down the option is right there to charge my phone. I would definitely buy again.
","
I now have 3 of these, they all work as advertised, nice and thin.
","
It works as it should , not the fastest put it is nice 👍
","
Definitely my favorite wireless charger. I am a sucker for quality construction and this charger just feels solid. It has a great look to it as well and a large range as far as positioning of devices while charging.
","
A nice charger to put up on the loft. Nice color to go with the rest of the decor . Fast charging too !!
","
I’ve been wanting to get a wireless charger for a while as I always break my wired chargers. So far this charger has done the job & it’s so easy to use. It’s also very slim which I love! The light turns from green to blue when it’s charging.
","
This is a great charger for many reasons: it has a slim design, fast charging capabilities, easy to use, no chords to plug in every time, reliable and durable, and a great low priceThis charger is just as good if not better than name brand chargers.  I would try this one first!
","
Great charging pad,well built and very thin. 10 watt output. My S21+could charge a little faster but I set it on there when I go to bed and it's charged in the morning.
","
Super thin but didn’t include the cord to plug into wall. Otherwise great product. Phone is picky where u place on the charging mat with a case.
","
I mainly got this wireless charger for the looks. It looks great. It also works great. It charges pretty fast and reliably and it’s pretty hard to miss the sweet spot when setting down a phone. This is easily one of the best budget friendly Qi chargers on Amazon.
","
I've only had this for a short period of time but so far, it works perfectly for me.I recommend!
","
I love it. Plugged it in and works wonderful. I have a cat who likes to bite cords. I sometimes leave the regular cords hanging out when I unplug my phone and he always bites it. This I hide the cord and don't have to worry about anything!
","
Like the overall size of the plate. It has enough weight to it that I don't have to worry about moving around or being knocked off when I grab my phone. Seems to do the job. Works well with my standard issue Samsung charger.
","
Not sure why it’s called wireless when it charges with a wire. The charger it’s compact, lightweight, I do love the color. It charges my 12 pro max fast.
","
This charger arrived in great condition and it feels really sleek. It has non-slip pads on the bottom which are really helpful. You do need to provide your own brick, but I always seem to have so many laying around so it's really not a problem.
","
Should come with the fast charge plug or some kind of plug. But still great design, doesn't feel cheap.
","
This charger is so cute, it’s very slick and modern looking! The first one I got actually didn’t work but they replied to my email right away and are replacing it! Quality customer service.
","
It works fine but the lights are sooooooooo bright! I can’t use it in my bedroom where I wanted to because it lights up and blinks which I’m sensitive to when trying to sleep! Works fine otherwise!
","
I would stick to charging with a cord when needing to during the day and use this at night while you sleep because the charging rate is excruciatingly slow. Takes my phone an hour to fully charge via a cord where this can take from 6 to 8 hours to charge.
","
I was expecting to have a modern looking wireless charger. The photos were looking good but there were cases I have seen real product different than the photo. This time it really exceeded my expectations! Build is very good. Very high quality material. Illuminated Lights are wonderful. Metal parts are very well crafted. It is an Apple quality product. Really worths to buy.
","
My phone needs to charge overnight to get from 5% to 100% charge. So if you are in a hurry, charge your phone using an adapter.
","
Good wireless charger.  Product is sturdy and powerful.
","
Very easy to use, super slim, great look.  This is a great buy for the price.  The charger does warm up a bit but they all do so that is expected.  I keep it next to my bed and the light stays on all the time but it is not too bright.
","
I bought these so it would be easier to charge my wireless headphones while at work. It worked immediately without any setup beyond plugging it in. And it looks really nice as well (I have the rose gold color). I'm very happy with this purchase!
","
Worked ok but super slow for a few days now it doesn't work at all.
","
lindo estéticamente pero no es carga rápida
","
It's a good charger with enough power to charge iPhone and and Android phones along with ofcourse Tozo Bluetooth ear buds.
","
Love the pink color, love the power it charges with and the price point was great! Would totally buy more of these for all over since my kids keep destroying the plug in on the phones!
","
This wireless charging pad is just so sleek looking! Extremely thin with a polished top and nice metallic green back. The lights are nice and not too obtrusive. Overall a great product for an amazing price. Will definitely buy again.
","
I've always wanted a wireless charger and this one looks really nice. Its only as fast as the cable you use so the white one that came with it is in storage. It doesn't charge my Smart watch very well but I didn't buy it for that so I didn't mind. It's smaller than my Galaxy s9 and I always have to make sure I place it on top instead of carelessly tossing it on or something.
","
I’ll never have to buy my wife a new charging cord again.  She tends to yank the cord out and every few weeks she says “honey my phone is not charging “.  With this little baby she just sets her phone on it and voila it’s charging.  Have had for a few months and no trouble.  Works great
","
Bought two. Excellent and good service.
","
Works great! Phone charges fast and doesn't ha e to be square on the pad like some other brands do. Very slim and sleek design that packs a punch. Charger does come out of pad
","
This wireless charger works. Very thin. And charges my phone or headphones
","
This charger is not as fast at the other wireless ones I got. It also has a precise position that you need to place your phone in order for it to work. The felt like top collects a lot of dust and is hard to clean. Otherwise it’s ok and sleek design is nice.
","
Extremely slow charge if and you maintain the connection with an iPhone
","
Love it
","
I bought two chargers, one for home and one for office. The home one works fine, but the office one I’ve used probably less than ten times since I bought it and it suddenly does not charge anymore. Kind of a waste, not sure how to even contact the manufacturer for help.
","
Sleek black look, accent lights when plugged in
","
The brand makes it seem like this would be a cheaply made charging pad, but it isn't. Have been using it for months and it works flawlessly and looks great. Would recommend.
","
Very good for galaxy S10 and charges faster than by cable. Only issue with this is the power cable is thicker than the plate and can affect charging if you position your phone over cable. Built in lights and color change to indicate full charger.
","
W1 wireless charger is easy to use and simple to store. It can easily be transferred for either travel or work, and charges with surprisingly fast efficiency. Highly recommended for Qi wireless charging if you’re trying to reduce office clutter.
","
I was never one for wireless charging. While my phone charges I like to be able to use it. But with working from home and not being on my phone when doing computer work, I have found this charger to be extremely helpful! It comes with a warranty as well which I always appreciate.
","
Just received this product today. It was easy to install, just comes with a USB cable but I was planning on plugging it into my computer anyways. I was afraid it might not work since I have a case and a popsocket on my phone but it worked with all that! Pretty cool. It's thin and sleek and looks really nice on my desk. Will probably buy another one for the bedroom too!
","
The charger has worked fine so far.
","
After a passenger left a pair of Tozo ear buds in my car and did not claim them after a couple of months, I asked my boyfriend if he had a cable to charge them. He didn’t, do I went online and took a chance on ordering my first ever wireless charger. It is magic!  And the boyfriends phone is able to charge on it as well!  Love it!
","
Please note this does not work with iPhone 7.
","
Got this product in April 2021. Very disappointed. It's a great design. However, charge does not charge at 10w for Samsung phones as advertise. I have a S20 Note 5G. As soon as I placed it on the dock, the fast charge light would come on in the phone, and immediately changes to a standard 5w charge. Also one night I left it on the charger overnight, and my phone didn't charge at all! Reached out to customer support and to let them know. They suggested using another wall adapter which I bought. 2-3hrs to get a full charge from 50% is a little to long for me, especially with better devices on the market.Will be returning.
","
I can use one charger for literally every phone and don't even need to plug in or out. No matter what you have in between the charger and battery,  it will charge.  Really loved the convenience. It made my life Easy.
","
Customer service reached out to me about this product I purchased. I told them I wasn't satisfied, so we reached a agreement. Great customer service.
","
The biggest challenge with this charger is you need to place your phone absolutely perfectly on one specific spot for it to charge effectively. I’m talking like an 8th of an inch margin of error. If you place it wrong even that much the charging will stop. I spend more time than I care to admit trying to place it perfectly, then double checking to ensure that it’s charging. Even then, sometimes I’ll wake up to a phone nearly dead that didn’t charge. I bought a very similar charger from a different company and as long as the phone is on the platform it charges.
","
Great bang for your buck. At $13 dollars this wireless charger does the job. I use it mostly for my earbuds but my wife uses it for her iphone too. I'll probably get a couple to put around the house. Great product.
","
Once you figure out the sweet spot where you place your phone, this thing works as designed.  Wireless charging is slower than the plugin version.  You do need your own charging cable and your fast charging adopter works best.
","
Charges great and very thin.  Looks slick and takes up very little space.
","
Pros- compact.Cons- does not support fast charging.Don't waste your money.
","
Bought this charger for use in a newly purchased Toyota Highlander.  It fits perfectly on the storage tray and is convenient to the USB ports.  It's great to simply lay my phone (Galaxy S10) in the tray and have it charged.  Charger is very thin and hardly noticeable when not in use.  Love this charger.  The only improvement I would make is a non-slip surface so the phone won't slide off.
","
I bought this to give as part of a gift basket.What caught my eye while purchasing was that it is beautiful and the white with silver trim fits the aesthetic of my gift recipient who like white and and neon lights. It looks great in person.
","
With battery at 49%, I can only get 9V at 1Amp (9 Watts) with the apple 20W charger.  plugging into the THunderbolt USB-C port on my docking station I only get 5V/1A.  It doesn't charge at all if I plug it into my macbook pro.  Magsafe apparently does not equal 15Watts automatically.
","
Great charger! Make sure to purchase a larger charger block to accompany it for faster charging on newer devices.
","
This product is so easy to use. Quick charging power. Just sit your device on the charger and it will be charged quickly. Although I haven't traveled with this device yet, it is very compact and and should travel very easily.
","
The unit is great.  Easy to use and compact.  The only suggestion would be to have a completely separate cable that plugs in to the unit.  With a unit separate from the cable, it will pack easier for travel.  Overall a good buy.
","
I have had this charger for several months and so far so good. Good quality and charges pretty fast. It changes colors from green to blue to let you know its charging.
","
Easy to use and Chargers Galaxy S10 phone too
","
It charges my iPhone 11 as well as my wife's iPhone 12, and best of all it charges AirPods and AirPods Pro!  I'm always forgetting to charge my AirPods so now I can just lay it on the charger and it is always ready to go. So nice!
","
I am very impressed with the size and style of this charger. It looks really nice on our nightstand. It also is very easy to find the sweet spot for charging! It doesn’t take several time repositioning the phone to connect with a charge like my prior charger required.
","
Won’t charge my AirPods and charges sometimes for the iPhone. But I love just sitting it down.Hard to rate this one. Don’t count on it being great but it does an okay job
","
Loved it easy to use easy set up but it should come with the plug to attach charger 🤷🏻‍♀️4 stars besides that I would has gave it 5 🌟
","
This charger works well and gives a full charge in a reasonable amount of time. What I like most is that it doesn't look like a big hockey puck sitting on the table. It's thin, stylish, and the LED lights are a nice touch.
","
I LOVE this charger. I use it at work. I am constantly moving at work so it is great to be able to sit my phone down on the charger and be able to quickly pick it up. Even better, it charges quickly!!
","
Charger works like it is supposed to. I like the lights on the top that tell you when the device is charging. It charges pretty fast, it thin and unobtrusive. I would buy it again.
","
Phone slides off
","
The charging speed of this charger is pretty slow but fine for an overnight charge. It works through most cases, but if a metal part on the back gets too hot, the plastic on this charger will melt (slightly).
","
It’s pretty self explanatory just charge your phone it works great and you can also charge your phone with the case on it’s really good I just don’t like how I didn’t know about the other colors at first.
","
What stands out most about this wireless charger is its aesthetics. This charger is the thinnest one I've owned and sleekest by far. The mirror finish looks beautiful with the flashy silver finish around the charger's bezel. The charging lights at a futuristic look to the charger. Along with its aesthetics, its charging capabilities are great and work like my expensive $50 wireless charger. I would definitely buy this charger again! You won't be disappointed!
","
Definitely a charge base you need for your wireless headphones and makes it easy to charge the case without having to worry about unhooking it from a wire. I can just place it to charge and then pick it up when I’m ready to go.
","
Bought this for easy charging of my Tozo T6 earbuds.  Both my wife and I have the Tozo T6 earbuds and this works great.  Well built.  I am very impressed with Tozo products' quality and packaging.
","
i was able to open it right up and put my phone on it to test it out and it worked right out of the box. i will be using it on my bluetooth earbuds next after I have it charged up. the description does say fast charger, but my phone isn't fast charging, though this doesn't matter for me seeing that I will be using it for the earbuds.
","
It does take a bit of time to charge but it’s worth the cost.
","
Very nice looking and works well
","
Works great, and it works with MagSafe and the logo. Not the fastest charger but worth it. No issues
","
I bought this charger for my work desk. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I have no issues charging my iphone 12. I even pulled out some 4 year old earbuds, and they charged without any delay or issues.
","
as expected
","
This is the perfect combination of elegant and functional.  The lines are stylish and spare.  It is as easy to use as placing wireless headphones or a cell phone on the charger - that's all it takes.  I'm very impressed.
","
Charger works great for my AirPods Pro and my Iphone XS Max. Great price too!
","
I love this! Its slim, sleek, super easy to use. It charges my Bluetooth or my phone. The price was great, it also came with complete instructions!  Not that tiny piece of paper in 3 languages the come with many of the electronics we have purchased over the last year.
","
Ordered 3 as Christmas gifts. Same thing, same price only different colors.One of them came in bigger box and has non-slippery surfaces on both sides.The other two have nothing.Recipients don't want to bother with returns, but that doesn't change the fact that someone somewhere didn't do their job right.
","
easy to use super excited my 1st wireless charger.
","
Easy to use but charges slowly. Still happy to have it, though.
","
I love this. I work half time in office, half remote. Easy to travel with and charges well.
","
3 month in and they almost stopped working completely. We have iPhone 13 pro max, we bought 4 of them and so far 2 down and 2 to go. Even when they work, they’re just weak, they don’t put out the claimed amount of charge. It takes all night to charge the iPhone, easier if we just plug the cable into the phone. They work good with EarPods charging case. Wouldn’t recommend it for iPhone users.
","
Charges fast and looks nice. Feels like glass.  Lights green when plugged in and blue while charging electronic. Wish it was USBC so I could use a longer cord.
","
I've been using this charger for a couple weeks now and it is great. I have a case and the charger works fine though it. The speed of the charge is not the fastest, but faster then some cords I've used. Overall, I'm very happy with this charger.
","
Overall, I like this charger. It is great!! Charges fast. The only thing I didn’t like is that the green light is on ALL the time. Light turns blue when the phone is charging. At night, the green light is very bright.
","
Nice charger, works well and charges fast. Power cord isn’t very long will reach from night stand to the flooor but that’s about it not further than that probably. I bough a longer one and it works perfect with it. Purchased a second after for the other side
","
Great wireless charger and sleek design.
","
Very little instructions. Should I leave the disk plugged in when not charging a device?  I needed a magnifying glass to read the limited instructions provided.
","
Super thin and sleek. Charges my iPhone 11 Pro Max quickly. Only downfall, is you have to be exact on placement. I have a thin clear case on my phone, that allows wireless charging. The usb-c that connects to the charger is slightly larger than the charger itself, meaning you need exact placement. You can see in the photo, the plug is slightly higher.  Lights are so flush and not bright at all
","
Very prompt delivery.Impressive design.I bought two since we just got new phones (Z Flip 3 & S22 Ultra).More often than not, we get a message saying Fast Charging is Incompatible. So, we wind up with very slow charging - or not at all (it just quits).We probably will just donate them to charity. Not worth trying to return.
","
I really enjoy this product! Amazing for charging without having to worry about charging cords getting in the way.
","
This product is a great alternative to the expensive Apple product. This has proven to charge my new iPhone very fast and I love not having to wait to charge my phone anymore. I also love how this can go with most cases. Also great customer service.
","
Got this on the recommendation from a friend.This has a very strong magnet and sticks to my iphone case.  The charger will charge through the case.
","
Nice to have a light that shows the status!!
","
I have had other wireless chargers that were very sensitive to the placement of the device or just did not work reliably.  This one works, it is easy to place the device, and charging time is good.
","
Product looks great, it looks well constructed and charges the phone as expected BUT ...It is slightly bigger than the Apple equivalent product so, if you try to put this into a car phone holder that was meant for use with the Apple Mag Safe charger it won't fit.
","
The charging disc is very compact can be located anywhere. It takes very little time to charge my phone with it and is very handy. It also displays a Green indicator light when fully charged and a blue light when it is still charging. Also inexpensive priced for the quality of the item.
","
This is all you need; it charges everything I have. My old iPhone 7, my new Samsung 10, and galaxy buds. The color fits really well with my buds, and it's overall really clean. The biggest reason I got this one was for compatibility for multiple devices, because I know some other wireless chargers don't work for samsung products. The LED light is actually perfect because it acts like a nightlight for me lol
","
Even though it is so slim, the rubber grips on the bottom help it not to budge and slide around, which is something I was worried about. I like how it also has an indicator for when your device is charging or not.
","
The charging pad is nice because you just place phone on it end it charges without having to hassle with cords; just leave the pad plugged in all the time. Indicator light lets you know when phone is fully charged. Seems to be quality made.
","
I love this wireless charger! it charges by usb-c cable and has a very premium build feel. It charges my phone quickly and the reflective material looks sleek and has led lights on it to show that it is on. 5/5 from me. Will purchase again if the need arises. It also comes with a free 1 year hassle free warranty.
","
It charges all the ear pods even air pros and my phones amazing and the quality is so good
","
Nice thin and smooth....so far so good!
","
Finish and color of charging pad is nice. Charging power is sufficient to fully charge samsung note 9. Easy to use. Hopefully its reliability will live up to its good looks.
","
This is such a great wireless charger. It was super easy to set up. You just plug it in and it is ready to go. I love that it works through my otter box case and popsocket. I give this 2 thumbs up.
","
I gifted this to a friend that has the i12 Pro Max. He loves it! It's out of the way and works great while charging on his laptop.It's easy to tote around as well.Nice product!
","
This is a great charging pad for my phone! I have a tech 21 case + popsocket on it and it still charges just fine. I use this charger in my office and the one complaint I have is that the cord isn't long enough. (It's still a decent length). Definitely recommend!
","
Great sleek design sits on my desk and super convenient to drop my phone on it and pick it up when I’m ready to go, I can take the charger anywhere on an inside pocket or in a bag. Really great for traveling or for normal Home use
","
This charger is beautiful, and functional in every way. It is effortless to set up, and just works right out of the box. The LED lights are a nice touch, and the fact that there are no branding(on the white version) makes it look so nice.
","
Great charger for my iPhone 12 Max.  Original charger did not work properly, however, customer service was excellent and shipped me a replacement which worked perfect.  Great company with a  GREAT customer support team.
","
Slick device, very satisfied overall. Didn't realize that to get it to fast wireless charge you had to buy or plug in factory charging base. I probably missed this in the details.I have them all around house and would recommend. Great price point!
","
Would be perfect if it didn’t light up like a Airport runway! Not usable in a bedroom IMO
","
Easy to use
","
The product is super easy to use but it does take quite a long time to charge an iphone -- even if you put the phone on airplane mode.
","
Works ok for earbuds but wont charge a phone in a case, and without the case it charges painfully slow.
","
I bought the pink wireless charger for my pink Todo T12 wireless earbuds. It is a solid little disc that works with the buds and my phone. At this price, I'm going to get another one for upstairs.
","
Can charge iPhone even with a thick otter box case on. No need to remove case.
","
Charges a little slow but still a good buy
","
Very slim & compact for everyday use as well as travel. Super cool modern design with minimal branding & only 1 LED indicator that doesnt blink constantly. Only thing I would change is for it to come with a fast charging adapter. Otherwise no complaints!
","
I didn't realize my iPhone XR had wireless charging, I bought this wireless charger for my TOZO earbuds. haha! I love it though, the pink is very nice and the rubber grippers and stuff is very good thing to add too.
","
The charger worked great until it didn't.  I reached out to Tozo and they are sending a replacement. BTW response was immediate.
","
What a great little charger, and I do mean little. It is as thin as a coaster. It charges my Galaxy S7 Edge easily and looks fantastic doing it. I love the look of the metal and mirror finish along with the charging indicator lights. This charger exceeded my expectations. It works perfectly with my Mophie battery pack. I would love to see a revised edition that has a magnetic attach feature to lock the phone in place.
","
These charging pads don’t work with the cases that Apple sells. I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a silicone case from the Apple store and the raised piece around the cameras holds it up so it can’t sit flush with the charging pad. I think this would be an issue with any case where there is a raised lip around the cameras because the pad is so large. Also, the blue LED light is a little aggressive for night (blue light is bad for sleeping) and your phone doesn’t fully cover it…. I would buy something else
","
I've tried several 2.0 rated charger adapters and the phone has fast charging enabled, and the phone just pops up a warning saying the charger is not compatible.It will slow charge.
","
At first was skeptical, I'm a name brand junkie, but i wanted a slick, low-profile charger, not bulky, must be modern looking, AND FAST CHARGE - Look no Further. This charger is AWESOME. I will be looking into additional products from this company.Oh yeah forgot, plus the price is nice :)
","
This is as simple a solution as you could ask for. A true wireless overnight charger that delivers. Easy to align for charging. Bought two one for me and one for wife. She loves it as much as I do. I would definitely purchase again.
","
This is a good solid product. Nothing amazing but it does the job and that's all you need
","
I like that it’s easy to use, has a great design and the cord doesn’t break as it typically just sits in the same spot and thus will last a long time!
","
I think this charger will blend into my new TV console that will soon arrive, as well as take up no space when I travel. Certainly, it began charging my iPhone as soon as I plugged it in.  I would love to have another to put on my bathroom counter.
","
This wireless charger is well priced and looks fantastic. The black option has a nice mirrored finish with an aluminum accent, similar to the look of the iPhone X. There is a blue light that indicates when a device is being charged, which is a nice touch. Charging is a bit slower than via cable, but that is expected for Qi charger, and a good tradeoff for the convenience of a charging mat.
","
It is a really great charger and looks great
","




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Love love love!!!... it’s beautiful sleek and fast. I used it for my New Galaxy buds in a Gold case that I also got here on Amazon and it works PERFECT! It also works great on our new iPhone 11. I bought 3 one for the living room so beautiful matches decor and 1 bedrooms and the other in my office
","
It is a pretty good charger and charges OK.  It, However does not fast charge on my S20.  The phone tells me it  is unable to achieve the fast charge mode with the charger.  Nice but not Great!!
","
This product is very simple and easy to use. I literally took it out of the box. Plugged it into a wall adapter and placed my device on it. I would recommend it to anyone. I have to see the charging power because i just got it. But overall it was well worth the purchase so far. I will update if anything happens.
","
Love this thing! It’s actually quite small I’d say the diameter of a large coffee cup. Plug in and use! The lights look great!EDIT: 5/27/2021Stopped working.For reference I got this new in november 2020... Mine no longer wirelessly charges my iphones, even with the cases off.
","
It’s pretty sleek and looks stylish. Works just fine. Love it !
","
Dollar for dollar best charger I ever bought. I have a thick case on my phone and charges with no issues. I also like it it flat n do not have to worry if it slips off like the standing ones.
","
Only had this a few days but so far it’s great. I really like how thin it is and the lights changing from blue to green to let you know if it’s charging are great.
","
I bought two of these and the second one didn’t charge my fiancé’s phone and she has a Galaxy S9 which y’all say is supported with the charger.
","
This wireless charging pad is amazing ! So sleek &charges my phone very fast . It’s thin enough to fit into your purse or a pocket so it’s easy to take on the go . Would recommend
","
Nice charger!  Charges my iPhone XR right through my super thick otter box case no issues, charges fast and looks very elegant and sexy.  Very Happy!  Plus a no hassle 1 year warranty!  What a great value!  Highly recommend
","
Es bonito, fácil de usar. Pero para un viaje, pienso es más cómodo usar el mismo cargador del teléfono con el cable de carga que viene con el cargador.
","
Love the slim small size of this charger. The charging indicator is nice and small so I can easily direct it away from me for sleeping, but bright enough to know it’s working. Wish it came with a carry pouch for travel. Very sleek looking!
","
Does what is said it would do
","
Wow.  The unboxing experience shows professionalism in the packaging and product design.  I like the sleekness of this unit as it makes a great travel companion.Would recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless charger and will buy a second one when needed.
","
Works as expected. Only wish it would fast charge my Galaxy Note 20.
","
I like the idea that all I have to do is lay phone down… no nightly plugging it in!!
","
I was excited to get this charger so no more plugging into my phone, however I was disappointed when I learned you have to lay it down a certain way on the disc or it will not charge. Secondly, I wish it would have the phone a little faster. Would not buy again...
","
The whole item is easy convenient and cute charges with no problem can slip in any purse  I love it.
","
There will be a little always on with the unit plugged in. So if you are having it in your sleeping area you will get a nice green or blue glow with no way of turning it off. Other wise it works as described.
","
At first I thought it didn't work, but then I realized I had plugged into a USB that wasn't capable of providing sufficient power. Once I realized that it worked perfectly, and the USB B to C adapter is nice. Tested with a Pixel 4XL.
","
Works best when connecting to a smart PD power compliant charger.  I have 3 of these so far and very happy with them.
","
I have no complaints. This has made my life immensely better. And for such an inexpensive price, I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to make your life immensely better either. Just look for the sweet spot (move your phone around the base until it's charging), and you are good to go.
","
It's so beautiful, I want to display it. Very classy look and subtle indicator lights.It charges very fast but you HAVE to have a 2A wall adapter for it to work. It will not charge with a 1A adapter.
","
Overall good product but charging level is really slow
","
Easy to setup, easy to use.  Alignment seems to matter with certain phones, but otherwise great product!
","
The magnetic feature is a nice touch but it doesn't stick great through a cover, but that is to be expected. However it does charge through a cover just fine. It charges faster than my old samsung one and would recommend it to anyone.
","
I recently bought this to go along with my iPhone 12. It’s sleek, super thin and looks great. Charges pretty quickly. There is a green light that displays when on its own, and a soft blue light that emits when something is being charged. It’s not too bright, didn’t disrupt my sleep.
","
Awesome product that fits on my desk without taking up too much space.
","
Works as I tended. Not much more to say.
","
Works very well. It is a little slower than plugging in a phone but that is just because wireless charging isnt as efficient. Great product for a great price
","
I have used Tozo products for a couple of years now so I knew they wouldn’t let me down with the wireless charger. Now, here I am using it every day with my new upgraded tozo earbuds and also my iPhone, etc. works great and it’s stylish without paying more than necessary.
","
Works great with my iPhone 12 Max Pro. I’ve had others that just never worked. This also works great with the case on! Older wireless chargers we have require me to take off my case. Very happy with this purchase!
","
Works great charge fast
","
This charger was delivered quickly, has a very nice high-quality look to it, and it works well. I like the little light in the front, which changes from green (not charging anything but ready) to blue (charging whatever is sitting on the charger. Quick simple and at a good price.
","
Love the size and the quick response to the wireless charger. Lightweight and thin. It works with my samsung fast charger. No complaints got two one for the wife too. Charging my Tozo nc2 earbuds on them. That's another awsome review.
","
It’s a good size for traveling and bringing it with you. It was pretty straight forward just connect to a fast charging adapter compatible with your phone and the light turns blue when charging. Has been working great so far I like the fact I don’t have to plug and unplug.
","
Bought this charger because of its sleek design. Couldn’t be easier to set up, just plug it in and put your phone on top. The color change is a nice touch. Great aesthetic, works as advertised, perfectly pleased.
","
Buena opción de carga compatible con diferentes dispositivos sin importar la marca, gran producto.
","
My phone's charging port failed, with inability to easily recharge my phone. This product will allow my to bypass the charging port, which will be great. I really like the slim design, and the use of quality materials.
","
Really nice looking and pretty but it charges sooooo slowly.
","
This is really what I expected really good quality and charges fast and it’s easy to use it’s really great!, the material are great and not so heavy but perfect for use plus the charging it’s really easy to use and safe to use at night it’s perfect!
","
This is a nice little wireless charger it's small convenient however I did have to purchase a $3 part in order to charge my phone on it m which is fine since I got it to charge my earbuds initially
","
I love this charge pad for the price and the amount of power it delivers safely to my phone but will shut off power once the phone is at %100. Its very easy to use and even though is doesn't come with a plug you can easily get one or hook it up to your computer/laptop, keep in mind that a high charge plug will allow your phone to charge faster.
","
The Rose Gold and mirror top looks classy and nice for a room. It easily picks up the iPhone and T6 earbuds when placed on it. It’s newer so can’t answer much of anything else but so far it is working perfectly for my needs.
","
I love the simplicity of the product and multiple colors it comes in.  I bought one for my kitchen then had to have one for my office too. My phone's cable charging port doesn't work so these were perfect to keep me charged up without having to get a new phone.
","
The product charges my phone pretty fast. The design is also very sleek, slim, and fits with my room aesthetic and people ask me where I get the charger all the time. When not in use there is a green light and when it’s charging it changes to blue. The light isn’t too bright either so it doesn’t affect me when at night.
","
Just got this. Works okay so far.Takes forever to actually charge phone.
","
Bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts, well I kept one for myself.  Works great, charges fast, and meets my needs.I did have to buy the AC Adapters separate, but they are very inexpensive.  For the price you cannot beat it!
","
This is a great charger for my iPhone and I haven’t had any problems of it charging with my case on. I love the design of this product and it is not exactly like the picture but it is still beautiful with a gold trim. It works great and I didn’t have a problem with using my wall plug in with the charger since it doesn’t come with one. Would recommend!
","
its compact and easy to use.
","
I love the way this charger looks but it did take a long time to charge. But I only used a regular cord and not a fast power charging cable.
","
This is my first time using a wireless charger but I love this product. The instructions that came with were very clear and made this a breeze. It charges my iPhone XR very quickly and my phone holds the charge the entire day, like a one and done. I also appreciate the sleek design for those looking for an aesthetic appeal as well. And the light makes it easy to know it’s connection is strong.
","
Just got this charger today! So far so good :)Works with Samsung S9 and my TOZO bluetooth earbuds. I ordered a different charger from another company in the past and had to return it because it kept disconnected.
","
At first i couldn’t find where to put my phone on the charger but you just put it in the middle. Just for fun, I placed my airpods pro on it and they charged! My airpods have this thick, sturdy case so i was surprised it worked.
","
It is okay. My phone always slip from surface. If it has grip then that would be great.
","
Great buy, its small, charges my phone and seems to have a pretty large sweet spot for putting the phone down. I haven’t had any issues with it not charging from being misaligned
","
Great product, worked for iphone 8, iphone 12 pro max with apple silicone magsafe case, and samsung s9.  Very easy to position the phones for charging.  I am going to buy another one so i can keep one bedside and one in my home office.
","
This charger is super easy to use and light weight to carry, it makes it much easier to charge my phone anywhere, highly recommended
","
Easy to use and fancy on office desk
","
The best thing about this charger is that the light colours indicate whether it’s charging or not and if the iPhone/AirPods is laying in the right position. I will be getting more!
","
Nice slim profile and charging shows when it is
","
Funciona muy bien en un Huawei P30 Pro, la velocidad de carga no es igual a la de un cargador de carga rápida, el producto tiene buen diseño es liviano y el acabado te permite tenerlo a la vista
","
Fast charges really well. Design is sleek and attractive however I wish you could disable the LED light ring. When not in use in a dark room, say on your night stand, it is very bright and forces you to put your phone on the charging stand to cover up the light. It lights up blue when charging but this is almost useless as your phone nearly covers the entire LED light ring.
","
I bought two of these and they are great.  The are easy to get ahold of and are great to work with.  You should feel at ease buying this product.  Really, Really Good.
","
Recently bought this as my first wireless charger and so far it’s done as advertised! No issues with either my iPhone 11 or AirPods charging on it. Beautifully designed with lights on the side to indicate charging status. The wireless charger itself is very sleek and easy to move. My only suggestion would be including an outlet plug as only the cord is included, but other than that it does it’s job!
","
Works great
","
One of the best chargers I have ever used. I have one that is over two years old and just purchased another to use in a different location. I can easily recommend this charger.
","
This charger is gorgeous, and it works good too! I love how sleek the design is. I have a thick Pelican case on my iPhone 11 Pro Max and it charges with the case on, no problem!! Excellent charger! I’m probably going to get a couple more for the office!
","
This charger is overall great - it looks slick, and works well. I love not having to deal with a whole bunch of wires, it helped make my space look much cleaner.My only caveat is that it makes this high pitched and quiet electronic... whirring? Grinding? sound of some variety when my phone isn't on it. I'm not sure if I just have particularly sensitive ears, but it's driving me a little crazy, so I have my phone on it more often than not just to make the sound stop.
","
It’s very chic and cute for my room. Love how easy it is to use.
","
Works well with newer outlet plug-ins. I do find the led light to be a bit too bright since it’s right next to bed on the table, but I rotate my phone to cover it and it still works. Nice modern look and sleek design.
","
Has trouble charging  with thick or bulky case with finger holder.
","
Looks good
","
This works as well as any wireless charger. I like the color-changing lights on the top of it. It also has a nice weighty feel to it, being slightly heavier than other chargers I have used which feel like they have almost no mass to them at all. The aluminum bezel around the top gives it a look of quality.
","
works great
","
Replaces two other  wireless chargers made by someone else because they randomly discontinued charging.  These have been dependable and were reasonable priced.  I couldn't ask for more... but we also find them to have an attractive appearance.
","
Thin, sturdy, charges fast. LEDs on pad are a bit bright but can be covered by your phone to block if need be.
","
It's not a super fast charger, but it charges at a nice pace, perfect for overnight charging (it doesn't take all night, of course). I really enjoy the sleek look and how it is not ""picky"" as to where you place your phone for it to start charging. Looks great in my nightstand!
","
Delivery was quick and product was well made. It enhances and beautifies the lighting of the room with the green LED lights. I bought this for my wife and she liked it and uses it all the time. No more plugging and unplugging of wires. Terrific product. I recommend this product.
","
Another great Tozo product at a super price!  It worked right out of the box and made charging my wife's iPhone 11 as well as my Samsung S20 Plus much easier than using a cable. The look and feel of this product was amazing, I would heartily recommend this device...
","
Charging device takes a long time
","
First time using and buying a wireless charger. Saw video reviews of this model and thought I try it. People say it doesn’t charge very fast but i thought the timing was fine if your not in a hurry and just hanging out playing games on your computer. Definitely worth $15
","
I bought this a little while ago and it works great, easy to leave my phone there overnight and have it fully charged. Mine actually stopped working randomly so the company graciously sent me a replacement.
","
My hands are kind of tiny and it fits nicely in my palm. Charge is pretty slow. Good for overnight charging. Overall I’m happy with my purchase. Will probably by another. Love the cute color options. Awesome price and the manufacturer offers a great warranty, too.
","
It’s good
","
So far, i am satisfied with this charger.
","
I've tried many other wireless chargers that are around the same price as this one; none of the others can even compare to this one. Most of the others stopped working within months, this one is still going strong after about 6 months. Plus it looks so sleek on my desk, and the charging power is great. I can get a full charge on my iPhone in about an hour.
","
Wasn’t what I expected but it does the job. It slow on charging but it definitely cheaper than the original. I’ll keep using it till I see how it is going to go. Was it worth the money? Ofcourse
","
I’ve had this charger for over a year, and it works well most of the time. However, are a random times it will stop working entirely (lights shut off and everything). The only way I’ve been able to get it working again is to unplug it for a while then plug it back in. 🤷🏻‍♂️
","
This is my 2nd TOZO wireless charger. I loved my first and unfortunately broke it after dropping it on my tile floor 😬. I almost didn't replace it until I realized how much I used it and how much faster it is than plugging in my devices.
","
It looks great but charge slowly and the light is always on, even with no device, which I do not like. Decent charger
","
I really liked this product for its charging power and the way it looks. It’s super thin and convenient to have by my computer during the day... I can keep using my phone cable free. I also thing it would be easy to use on a knight stand. Nice product!
","
The unit has a very low profile and is small enough to be discreet on a night stand. The LED indicators are handy to have and not overly bright. It is slower to charge than most wire-connected chargers but this is to be expected. Have been using for less than a week. Fast shipping, excellent packaging.
","
Got this for my 15yo son who has gone through I don't know how many charger cords due to them breaking fast. He likes this charger and it works well. I might buy one for myself
","
This is a really nice wireless charger! It looks great, works as it should (perfect for the Tozo wireless headphones!), and is usb type c which is really handy, as most of my devices now use this connection. Highly recommended!!
","
I love this charger so much I bought one for my friend too
","
Wasn’t sure what to expect when I got rice caught up in my phone charger  So I decided to try this. It works like a charm and although not as fast as traditional chargers, it works great.
","
Love how slim it is. Soft cushion top, led light it not super bright (plus in my book). Not a fast charger, it usually takes about 2hrs to completely charge my phone from 20%. However my phone still holds a charge all day, so I charge at night when sleeping.
","
I love this charger, you come home from work and lay it down.....its charging! We have iphone8 and you just make sure the color changes from green to blue and you know its on there correctly to charge.
","
Good cord length and looks nice.
","
This is my first time using a wireless charger and I don't know why I hadn't bought one earlier. This wireless charger is easy to set up and use and doesn't take up much space. Charges my phone quickly. So far I'm very pleased with this purchase!
","
I bought this wireless charger for my wife since the one I bought her previously was starting to give out. This charger charges her Galaxy S10 way faster than the old charger and it looks better too. Overall 5 stars. Let's see how it holds up over the long term.
","
The TOZO wireless charger works amazingly well. We have tested on iPhone XR and iPhone 11 Pro with no issues. It charges our devices efficiently. Also, just tried it with iPhone AirPods Pro with no problem. Highly recommend this affordable and sleek looking charger to anyone looking for a wireless charging base.
","
In the past month I have purchased several wireless chargers, this Tozo charger is simply amazing. Straight out of the box as I was unwrapping this you could feel the sleekness and overall weight of a quality product. Charged my phone from 74 percent of 100 percent in under one hour time. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. This is my second Tozo item, this company is all about quality..
","
So this whole wireless charging thing is new to me. When I upgraded my phone I bought the charger just to try it out. The unit is small, sleek, unobtrusive, and does exactly what it's supposed to do! I work around fire, knives, moisture, and heat so I have a GIANT case on my phone. It has no issues with charging! I was so impressed I bought my girlfriend one as well. Thanks!
","
This is an excellent wireless charger! It’s a clean, beautiful design. Very thin compared to other wireless chargers I’ve had and not as finicky about placement (doesn’t have to be completely centered). It has soft lights on the top and the bottom that are green when not in use and blue when charging, but they are very subtle and do not light up my whole room disturbing my sleep. Great value! Highly recommend!
","
Terrible charger. Put my iPhone 11 on the charger (no case) for over an hour and it loses battery.Update: Received a defective charger. The company willfully refunded me.
","
I bought this for myself but my pop socket got in the way for me to use it, but my mom loves it! Very handy and easy to use. Is great for someone who’s charger port is broken but doesn’t want to get a new phone. Wish I could use it but my pop socket is too important to me lol
","
charges ok but not fast as advertised
","
I was pleasantly surprised with the wireless charger., I had purchased 2 prior to this one and specs and pictures were all hype.  This proved true to their description,  it works with my Note 10 plus and Note 8.  Finally at night if need be I can leave the phone on charge and it stops charging when it reaches 100%. Great product.  Let's hope for the best.
","
I like this overall, it doesn’t charge my phone as fast as the original charger it came with but it’s overall easier to use
","
I got this and then my wife wanted one too!Had about two years now. Still working well!
","
Easy to use. Loved while traveling
","
I like how small it is.
","
I spend $12 on this wireless charger and I received a product that exceeded all of my expectations. It charges fast, it's really thin, and it looks great. It even comes with a free one-year warranty. Would recommend to anyone who wants a classy, sleek wireless charger for their desk.
","
I can use this for all of my devices! My iPhone my husbands galaxy and my tozo earbuds! This thing is amazing’ I couldn’t recommend it more! Have it right by my bed side for easy access
","
Love the navy blue color. Thin with grip behind to avoid sliding. Charges quick with the 2.0-3.0 iq charging block. Charges my AirPods 2. Charges my iPhone 12 with case(not sure how thin/thick is my case). Pad is not too big nor too small
","
It’s very sleek and thin. It’s overall aesthetically pleasing. I’ve tried it a few times and sometimes it doesn’t detect my phone right away (takes a couple seconds. Might be because of my phone case) but overall it’s a great purchase so far!
","

My old wireless charger (not by this brand) broke within 10 days of use. Nice thing about this brand is the one year warranty they offer. No issues so far and very pleased with the charger thus far!
","
I love this charger! It’s stylish and easy to travel with. It’s very convenient for work and home without having a charger cord connected to your phone. It charges really fast, and I love the colors that lets you know when it’s charging/charging complete. I plan to purchase a white one as well
","
I had hoped it would charge my ipad but it didn't.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.
","
Great little device for iPhone 12 mini
","
For the price, so far pretty happy with it .Update, after 1 week, it works sometimes,  its great when it works,  but there are times, my brand new phone is super hot while on it after half hour, and over night, its still 60% charged.  so not good.
","
It doesn’t work for an iPhone 7 Plus 😞🤦🏾‍♀️
","
This is my first wireless charger.  Very impressed with the thin profile and overall design. Used my S10 charger with the supplied USB cord. So far, well pleased.Also have the Tozo T12 ear buds. The case charged fine. Would by both again.
","
The phone has to be set in a specific area to charge properly
","
Very easy to use and the thin, flat design is perfect so nothing gets knocked off easily. This is the first wireless charger I've had that I haven't had to take my phone case off in order for it to charge my phone.
","
It is a good charger
","
I was pleasantly surprised with this little charger. It's build quality is very high and the LED indicator lights are bright enough to notice but not obnoxious. I originally purchased this as a stand in charger for work, however after using it I wanted it at the house instead for my personal office. The cord length is so/so, pretty standard. All in all I am very pleased with this and may get another for my night stand, hah!
","
This product does NOT work very well. I set my android cell phone on it...it will charge for a couple minutes...then STOPS charging. For days now my cell is barely charged... 8%, maybe 10%,...then back to 5%.When Im not on my cell...it is sitting on this product....Not  charging or barely charging. I was vigilant trying to get it to work. Checking on it constantly. For hours...cell sitting on this product...NOT CHARGING! I give up...my advice...do not purchase it. Not worth the $12 I paid for it. Finally gave it to my daughter.. surprising it does charge her Apple/iPhone. She's happy, I'm not!
","
One of the best purchases I have ever made. I can charge my iPhone and my AirPods. The only thing that I don’t like but happens for every phone and any charger that isn’t brand original is that it won’t charge fast.
","
Looking for a sleek wireless charger?  Look at this product.  I have tried it with iPhone and Android and both work perfectly well with their cases attached.  It can also charge your Airpods case with a protective cover on it as well.  Very happy with my purchase.
","
Got to charge wireless earbuds and its great for that... may get another for my guest bedroom.
","
When using this charger, I have to take my phone out of the case. Additionally, I have to monitor the charger to ensure that my phone is charging. Worked great for my AirPods. Not the most effective phone charger.
","
I have been using the charger for some days now in my office space and I really enjoy its look; it is slim, and elegant in comparison to others. I haven’t had any issues with the placement of the phone to charge it. Even though the charging is not as fast as I expected, I assume it’s because it is connected to the laptop and not directly to an outlet.
","
This is a super high quality charger that is extremely durable and solid. I originally bought one to go with something else then decided to buy two more. Works with both  our iPhones and our Android phones. Very highly recommended!
","
I bought 7 of these chargers for Stocking Stuffers, and everybody made a point of telling me they loved them.
","
This charger has been great - my iPhone's charging port is loose and stripped and won't charge well with a traditional charger. This allows me to charge without worrying about ""keeping the cord at the right angle"" to ensure it actually charges. Would recommend!
","
Exceptional wireless charger, lightweight, blends easily in any decor — so I have them in a number of rooms — we use them whenever we or guests need a quick charge for air buds or phones. Great product.
","
Fast charges my girl's s9 with a big old case on it, fast charges my s10+ with a case on. Smooth looking, comes with a usb c cable, fast charges samsung's. Can't go wrong folks, got 2.
","
WILL OVERHEAT YOUR GOOGLE PIXEL BUDS 2. I don't know why, it charges my galaxy buds live just fine, but my Google buds 2 will overheat and be painful to the touch when left on the pad. Otherwise extremely nice charger, I wish they were compatible with my pixel buds
","
This wireless charger did not disappoint! Charging power is satisfactory. I even accidentally dropped it on my tile floor AND it was safe, I was so relieved. It's so easy to use I'll be buying another one soon for my other device.
","
Hasta ahora muy bien
","
We love this product! Bought two of them for Christmas & we are very satisfied. Sleek glass design, large surface area to place the phone, and provides an excellent charge. Very cool blue and green indicator lights; just a little bright on your ceiling at night.
","
This is actually the first wireless charger I have used.  It works perfect for my phone and charged faster than I expected.  Also charged the Tozo T6 wireless earbuds.  I love the look and color (gray) and the low price.
","
This is a nice looking charger with good functionality. They also have superb customer service if any issues arise!
","
I bought this on Dec. 29, 2019. Unfortunately it stopped working March 27, 2020.Update: I’m changing my rating to reflect good customer service. A staff has reached out to me to rectify my issue as I have likely gotten a defective  item. I was offered a refund or a replacement of item. I appreciate their efforts to satisfy a customer like me.
","
I give this product 5 stars. I just received it today and haven’t had any issues! My only critique is I wish the LED lights were just a little brighter because they are hard to see if the daytime, but it’s perfect when it’s dark because they aren’t bright enough to bother you. Super slim, lightweight. Worth the small fortune lol
","
Had to return it, they were very helpful in the process
","
It's kinda crazy. I love it
","
This little guy charged my new iPhone 12 Pro Max in under and hour the charging power is amazing and it was so easy to use .  The Tozo wireless charges is a great price and big value get one or two
","
These chargers seem to be very well made.  They are equipped with non-skid strips on the bottom as well as a full non-skid pad on top so your phone won't slide around or off.  The phone connection is immediate upon setting it on the pad and charging is quick. The blue is more of a slate blue - very conservative, but a nice alternative!
","
The device seems fine but I gave it three stars as I was send a gray one when it was supposed to be the Navy Blue.  Too much trouble sending back so I'll keep it.
","
I have had this product for almost two months now. I absolutely love the way it looks. I use it as a backup charger on my desk in my home office, so I don't necessarily use it every day. It seemed to work ok at first, but lately I've noticed that it will charge my iPhone 8+ or AirPods Pro for a few minutes, and then it will stop charging. The light on the device (which is very cool) will change from green to blue when it starts charging, and I've noticed that after a couple of minutes, it will change back to a solid green or sometimes a flashing green. Of course now that I'm writing this, it seems to be charging just fine, so perhaps it's an intermittent occurrence. I really want to give this product 5 stars if it would work properly.
","
Excellent product. Well made and super easy to use right out of the box! I love that I don't have to overuse my charging port anymore. This means less wear and tear on my phone over time! It's also compact enough to take along in my purse! Great buy!
","
It doesn’t charge unless it is too plugged in
","
Like the wireless charger! Easy to use and very light.
","
I have to say that this company is one of the best when it comes to customer service.  They provided an updated version of my product in no time at all and followed up to make sure I was satisfied.  Wow!! And the product is perfect! Plan on purchasing a few more for around the house.
","
I love this charger. The smooth feel and design are appropriate to take anywhere with you. I never worry about going to the bedroom to charge my phone at home, just put it on the wireless charger where ever it is in the home. I always move it to the room that I am in. Within 15 mins, I have enough charge to use the cell phone again. Love it!
","
Works good and for the price you can't beat it. Only issue is that the light stays on even at night which can be a bit annoying but that's trivial.
","
The design of the charger is clean looking and has a high-quality feeling. I bought this product because of its thin profile, overall quality in materials and its reasonable price. I have noticed an increase in the speed of charging over my other wireless charger that I bought at a similar price. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable wireless charger that looks great and works well.
","
This charger is very attractive and works well.  It’s a lot slimmer than the one we had before, and the lights are a nice touch.
","
The charger looks great, is a smaller than normal wireless charger and is perfect charger with the iPhone 12 and above with mag safe function. It works perfectly with my Pitaka case (slightly less magnetic force). It seems like it fast charging as well. Great!
","
Handles fast charging (with the correct adapter). The third one keeps beeping and charging stops. Starts again then beeps and stops. This continues until I remove it.
","
This charger is very sleek! It’s thin, small, and lightweight. It charged my IPhone 11 within a couple hours when it was dead. I like not having to worry about plugging my phone in, I simply set it on this wonderful device. I bought rose gold and love the color.
","
I love this so much I had to buy two! Sleek, attractive design. Charges wonderfully and you cannot beat the price. I am charging an older iPhone 8 Plus, and it works jut FYI. You will not regret this purchase!
","
I have only been using this charger for a few days but so far I love it. Super easy to use only thing I’d change is I wish the cord was a little longer. Still would repurchase though.
","
inconsistently recognizes phone on the surface, charging goes in and out without phone moving.
","
The wireless charger works perfectly. It doesn't charge super fast, but I'm not worried about that. I use it to charge my AirPods Pros and it works wonderfully. I can set my AirPods on the charger and leave it overnight, and it's fully charged by the morning! I'm also glad that they chose USB-C, as micro-USB is easily damaged.
","
I bought this product after using Ikea’s 5w wireless charger. I liked the simple design of the Ikea’s, but the charging speed was really slow that my phone usually won’t be fully charged overnight. So I was looking for a charger with a simple, sleek design with faster charging speed, and this one is exactly what I was looking for! So far the charging speed seems much faster than the 5w charger.
","
I'm catching up with newer technology slowly.  I received a pair of the wireless charges and they seem to work great.  I have noticed though that placing the phone top of the charger is insufficient, you have to find the right spot for it to charge.  I have awoken to a dead phone on top of the wireless charger a number of times.
","
Works well but charges a little slow. 9/10.
","
Deducted a star only because it doesn’t charge as fast as other chargers.. not sure if it’s the actual product or the part that plugs into the wall.
","
Easy to misalign your phone. You can verify charge with lights on pad.
","
Perfect!  Charges my phone while in pelican case. Sticks to the back, not strong but enough to pick the phone up without it falling off. My current case is NOT a MagSafe case. Ty tozo for another great product
","
I just got this charger, and it is doing an amazing job.  I use same for charging my iPhone and my Tozo T6 wireless earbuds at nights.  But morning both are fully charged.  I also love the fact that it’s slim and easy to carry with you.
","
Was a little hesitant about the technology and it’s effectiveness, but with the cord driven charging problems with my iPhone, I thought I’d give it a try. I’m never going back to the cord again and I’m buying more for everyone in my household.
","
Works as intended. The charging port on my Pixel 3 XL went out a while ago. So I decided to buy this to charge it wirelessly. Works great! No problems here.
","
This is one of the best wireless chargers at this price . I had a wireless charger before but it was really slow, bright  and fragile. This charger is sleek and charges fast. It has a small led light which is convenient on night table. Good value for money.
","
It's just as sleek looking as the listing makes it out to be. Works perfectly with my existing charger and cord. LOve the lights that change color to let you know when it's done. Very convenient.
","
Works with my iPhone 12 and EarPods. Works as advertised.
","
It’s slim and does not take a lot of room. It’s perfect on my desk working from home. And you cannot beat the cost. I will have to buy another when I go back to the office one day. Charges perfectly!
","
Just received this charger and so far so good. I did have to figure out which adapter to buy to go with it which was a challenge. I wish they would tell you which ones work with it. 😞
","
Design is great! But my galaxy s20 rejects the ""fast wireless charging"" capability
","
Just stop reading the reviews and BUY IT!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, GREAT PRODUCT WITH A GREAT PRICE! I bought one for myself and then my husband wanted one so I bought him one as well!
","
this new version is super slim and still does the great wireless charging as before. usb c cable included which is nice since i dont have many usb c devices yet. fairly large surface area so its super easy to place a device on it and get it charged.
","
Only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have fast charging capabilities
","
I loved the design and look of it. I had a glitch with it at one point but the company was great about correcting the problem and making sure I was satisfied. It really is a nice, think and slick charger. Charges about the same as a wall charger but a much neater decorative piece.
","
Small and discrete. It’s the perfect classroom charger. I can still see notifications but my kids (I teach elementary...we’re still learning boundaries) don’t really know what it is so they don’t mess with it! It chargers pretty quick with no issues!
","
What a great wireless charger!  I use it all the time.  No more plugging in cables.  It charges my devices quickly.  Highly recommended!
","
This is my first wireless charger and boy am I impressed. Bought to charge with the Tozo T10 Wireless Earbuds and right at this moment I'm charging my Iphone.  Will have to get another to take traveling.
","
I love this charger! It not only looks nice (I enjoy having it on my desk at work, it makes my space look cleaner and nicer than a bulky charger) but it charges both my phone and my boyfriends phone quickly. I bought another brand of charger at the same time to use in different places and I enjoy this charger more than the other brand that I bought. I'll definitely be buying again!
","
As always another excellent product from TOZO.Half the price of the same Apple product. I have used many chargers in this by far is the easiest to use while traveling and it charges the phone quickly. I would certainly recommend it.
","
It’s nice and small (very light) which is perfect for everyday and also traveling. Looks also very sleek and charges my phone right away every time. No complaints. An idea would be to add a different material to the bottom to help keep it from sliding around on smooth surfaces
","
It’s really easy to use and so happy that I don’t need to deal with the charging cable.
","
I bought this because of the design, and the fast charge. I do have to remove the case from my phone to charge, but it lights up to let you know it is charging. It has a constant green lit look, so heads up if you don't like constant light. I like the lights, and it brings people's attention to it. It works with my wireless headphones also. I just love it!
","
The circular light around the charger do not work. When I contacted them they asked me to send them, picture of the charger as used, picture of the adapter as plugged in, copy of the invoice. I could have easily returned it and it will be no problem.
","
I was very satisfied with this charger! It is sleek and easy to use. It may seem like a downside to not be able to use your phone while it’s charging but in the long run it will keep your phone battery healthy!
","
10 watt for my S9 Samsung is nothingI have to put it for like 3 hours and half to charge full sometimes 4hNot usable with magnetic attachment at the back of your mobile
","
Shiny. Looks like glass. Turns blue when charging and green when done. Works great with my iPhone 8+.
","
Purchased the charger due to the convenient size. Doesn’t come with adapter only the wireless pad and cord. A shame the charger wasn’t good at all. I would have my phone charging for an hour and still be at 10% . Also if your phone is completely dead this charger will not turn it on. I definitely do not recommend purchasing this charger.
","
I love this wireless charger! It works great and looks great on my night stand. It's very thin, high quality, easy to use with a small light, letting you know when your charge is complete. I'm buying 2 more for gifts. Wonderful Christmas gift at a great price!
","
Small will see how fast it charges. Very cute and modern looking
","
I love how thin it is. So easy and convenient.
","
I specifically purchased TOZO W1 charger for my AirPods, and it charges them better than expected. Easy set-up and a BIG charge for such a compact device.(My phone has found its way to the TOZO a few times, and that too, charges very well.)Very satisfied, thus far.
","
I use this wireless charging pad for both my phone and my mouse. The LEDs on the sides of the device are a great indicator to show when your device is charging. Super thin and it doesn't slide around on the surface it's placed on. Great price too!
","
Super cute and super sleek! Looks exactly like picture. Although the charging time COULD be faster, it works well to leave my phone on over night and fits the aesthetic of my room.
","
I got this for Christmas, and the charger works great for my phone. I travel a lot, and this is very handy. It also charges other items, but I haven’t used it for anything but my phone at this point. Good product and good price.
","
I have purchased several wireless chargers for myself and family over the years and this is my favorite thus far!  Extremely thin, two-tone LED guides to assist at night/low-light, quick charging and USB-C power port all make this the favorite!  Strongly recommend.  Also comes with one-year extended warranty if you register online once received.
","
This charger works very well. It doesn’t come with a plug, just a USB cord but that was fine. The big problem is that I bought this because it was aesthetically pleasing and went with my decor. The device itself is very pretty. What the pictures DON’T show is that they have a very bright glowing neon green light all the time. The light is blue when it is charging. But when it is just sitting there all day, neon green. It’s pretty ugly and not what I was hoping for.
","
It's super easy to use and I got it to try it out and it just turned out much better than I hoped and it also just looks good. It does have light going all the time so if your sensitive to light it might not be good for you. It lights up different colors to let you know if it's charging, not charging, and when the thing is fully charged.
","
Quality product! This disk comes with a (USB-C on body to USB-A) cable but no charger.I like the silicone on this one because it has matte look and is non-slip. Customer Service isfriendly and helpful. I would buy again.
","
Great product!! Nice weight and looks amazing.
","
Love this charger so much I bought a second one.  I have it out in my living room and guests are impressed that it works through the phone case.
","
I like this charger. It charged my S9 quickly for a wireless charger. Love the pink! I wish it came with an ac adapter but it seems like most of them don't so I went with it anyway because of the great price.
","
This is a good wireless charger but most importantly, it looks great and takes up hardly no space! It charged my new pixel 5 about 20% in an hour and I have a slim case on my phone. Very happy with the purchase!
","
I like that I can simply lay my phone and boom I’m charging. I’ve put the charger across the room and leave my phone to charge at night to make me get up in the morning.
","
Overall what I love about this wireless charger is that it is accessible and convenient. Very easy to move around and to travel with. Great as a secondary wireless charger. I also have it affixed for my desk as well.
","
I purchased this to have at work for my XS Max. This morning my phone wasn’t charged all the way to 100 and after about 3 hours charging and rarely being used, no apps open, it’s only to 84%. This doesn’t seem very “aFast” to me.
","

 Good magnet that works with your bare phone if you need a wireless charger this is a good option. Tozo consistently makes pretty good products for phone accessories and this one is no different.
","
Takes to long to charge iPhone X. I left it in there for an hour after being completely dead, and it only brought it to a charge of  40%
","
I gave this as a gift and the adapter was not included. It does state that but it's basically fine print that I didn't notice. It costs an extra $15 at least to get the proper adapter for fast charging to work. Just wanted to give you a heads up.
","
Sometimes it doesn't charge and it to have the wire unplugged and plugged back in.
","
Great charger for your phone and earbuds! I like how you can watch the colors to see when it's done. Great price and the brand is the same as my earbuds that I purchase. Definitely not disappointed!! Great product and price!
","
Great charger, but that light you can't turn off is really annoying
","
I love how fast this wireless charger is! Also that I was able to choose what color I wanted. It isn’t too big in size either so it fits nicely on my nightstand table.
","
Use it mainly for my iPhone 13 Pro Max but also use it with my Toso earbuds the charge wirelessly and works like a champ
","
This product works very well.. I have a popsocket and a case on my phone and it still charges through. Depending on how my phone is sitting on it sometimes it does fast charging through the popsocket. Sometimes it only wireless charges it. Fantastic product. Already ordered a second one.
","
So far so good great product looks really nice
","
This wireless charger works great and is extremely convenient. It's nice not to worry about a cord when I wake up. The charger charges quickly and preserves my battery by not overcharging. Everything came as described.
","
I was a bit skeptical that this charger would work with my phone since I have a phone wallet on the back of my phone, but it works! It's so convenient and its design is so sleek!
","
My Mom really loved it! But it was too quick to heat up. Might be best to not use it for a long period.
","
I bought this to charge wireless headphones and it works great for that! It also charges my iPhone which is very helpful too. It does not charge Samsung phones FYI.
","
This charger is super nice! Easy to have on my desk and I like that I can move it anywhere so it’s never in the way. Also it’s slim and small enough that it’ll be good to take traveling. Very happy with purchase!
","
No problem
","
Doesn't work for airpods 2 ( i only bought it to use with that, so its a waste of money)
","
Can't go wrong with this at all! For someone who been through multiple wireless charger, this is the best one in all aspects. The power is better than other wireless chargers out there and it looks and feels the best of them all.
","
I bought TOZO wireless earbuds months ago and got someone a pair for Christmas. I love them so much and started looking at other products and found this. Works great, small enough to put in my bag, and a great price.
","
Very slow charger. Easy to use, convenient,  but make sure you have time to wait for it to charge.
","
Portable, simple and solid, but they do seem to make some wireless recharging devices very hot during charging. I would be careful and test charge new devices by timing the charge and seeing how hot they get during that time. My note 10 charged fine, but my wireless earbuds got really hot after I forgot about them on the pad.
","
I really like this product's simple solid design. The light is barely visible but keeps you notified if the charger works properly. Now I can charge my phone or galaxy buds without a problem. Taking it with me on the road is also easy. Great product.
","
Great item at a reasonable price. We have two and have bought them as gifts. Really good quality chargers.
","
More responsive than my Anker. I love the look and it’s really thin
","
I ordered this wireless charger because I got a new iPhone XR and I wanted to be able to charge without a cord. This wireless charger by TOZO is a beautiful, sleek, circular pad that fits my phone perfectly. As soon as it makes contact with my phone, it immediately starts charging, quickly too. I recommend this wireless charger to anyone with a new or old device with the capabilities to charge wirelessly.
","
This charger is so sleek and CHIC! I got the white one and I absolutely love it! It's small enough to not take up a lot of room in your bedroom, purse, backpack, but large enough for your phone to be placed onto and charged.
","
It charges my phone kinda slow but great for AirPods. It’s a staple at work.
","
I have a Galaxy S10. I'm not sure of its thickness, but my phone case is what I'll describe as 'rugged'. No issues with charging and it charges my fun fast!
","
This charger is the bomb! Light weight, sleek, and picks up my phone the second I set it down! I’ll never own another wireless charger! Only downfall is the cord is a tad shorter than I’d like but still manageable!
","
First wireless charger for me. Current phone doesn’t use but purchased with tozo 12 buds and will also work with my tozo 10 buds as well. Seems to hit the Mark of excellence dead center like all my other Tozo products
","
I’m very surprised at the quality of this product! I’ve never used a wireless charger before and always thought they would be cheaply made and too thin but this is very nice. Looks impressive on my desk. The way it was packaged was nice also. Very secure in the tray with a velvet insert to protect. Very happy!
","
Sexy product and packaging comes with an 18 month (extended) warranty when you register at the vendors website.Plugged it in and placed wireless earbuds/wireless charging case on the rubberized/non-slip pad: will see how long it takes to charge using a non-QC 110v adapter.
","
I purchased this for use with an iPhone X.  It works perfectly even through my wireless charger compatible case.  It has a very elegant design, charges the phone fast, uses high quality materials, and so far appears to have a top notch build.  The charger only gets slightly warm when used all through the work day, and doesn't transfer much heat to the phone.  Highly recommended.
","
Originally got this for my phone and headphones but it did in fact not work for my phone. It did in fact work for my headphones but I got the headphones linked to this charging pad. Just beware.
","
Enjoy its low profile. Power indicator lights are a nice touch, but not too bright.
","
I can put my ear buds on there and it charges fast…. I love it. Highly recommended!
","
This was well worth the money! It’s very slim and light weight. I like the light up colors when it’s charging. The charge is very fast! It also charges with my iPhone 11 phone case. I would definitely buy again for a friend or family member!
","
Ya my coworkers stole my charge pad and then fired me for asking about lol
","
I’m using it as a last resort charger. It has a slow charge. Maybe best for iPods.
","
Works great.  Easy to use.  So much simpler than plugging in.
","
I have two Toso chargers that I’ve had for a couple of years and they’ve worked great. They were larger in size and I also have used Toso earbuds which are pretty good. But I got this in the mail and plugged it in that night to put my earbuds on to charge. In the morning I picked it up and it burned my hand as well as burned a hole in the wood of my brand new nightstand! I returned it and got my money back but who is going to pay for my nightstand?
","
I love the sleek design and fast charging power. Not to mention, it charges my iPhone through my otter box with no issues! This charger gives my desk the clean and modern design that I was looking for. Will definitely by again!
","
The product seems to work well  but I have a fairly thick case so it wouldn't fast change.
","
I moved my Samsung wireless charger with a light that is way too bright to my office and now use this one by my bedside. The lights are on the top, so I can position the phone to completely cover them at night, so they don't keep me awake like my old Samsung charger did. Much better!
","
Very easy to use and looks great. One of the best purchases I've made in a while. Now I can simply just set my phone down to charge it, which works great as my charging port has begun malfunctioning. Another good product from Tozo
","
Small, does not take up space in the bag. Like the led changing when cell is charged.
","
I bought this in March of 2020, it worked great up until November 2020. The wireless charger will not charge my phones anymore just flashes green. Was great while it lasted...“Update, the charger still works, my phone needed to be reset and now the charger works!”
","
Pretty much this wireless charger charges extremely slow and is not very reliable. I had to find the sweetspot just to get the alert that it is charging even then I left it for an hour and came back to it only gone up a tiny percentage. I wouldnt get it if you want to swap from wired to wireless.
","
Works well. Nice, large sweet spot means I can just put down my phone. Very thin design, very unobtrusive. LED status lights are not too bright - can use at night near bed.
","
Love the way this wireless charger looks, it’s super sleek and modern plus it charges both my iPhones 11 and 12 perfectly. It also came with a 1 year warranty which is always good. Great price! Would def recommend
","
Ordered the gray version and am impressed with the overall build quality & nonslip rubber top.  It's very thin yet feels very high quality.  The indicator light is just a pinhole that is just enough to see but isn't blinding.
","
Sleek, works well.
","
I have to say that I’ve had really good user experience with this device. Simple to use and sleek design. You just plug it in and it starts to work immediately.One feedback for the makers, in the instruction please include what the different colors refer to. For example:Purple means it’s chargingGreen on standbyBlinking green means not charging etcOverall I’m very satisfied.
","
I love how it lights up when in use. I didn’t see the point of these but it stops the issue I have sometimes where I plug in my phone before I go to sleep and wake up to find it wasn’t in the whole way.
","
You have to remove your case every time or it won’t charge
","
Works as expected - slower than plugging in but convenient
","
Love that it lights up so I know it’s on and working. My iPhone 11 Pro Max recognizes it immediately through my case which is awesome. Can’t wait to set this on my nightstand and forget about it
","
Awesome looking fast charger. Charges my Iphone very fast.  If I have one complaint it would be that the light on it is very bright!  It's not the kind of thing you are going to want facing you while you sleep!
","
This was my first wireless charger - I like how it works but the surface arrived all scratched up.  Not a big deal but no one likes the feeling of receiving a used product at a brand new price.  Attempted to contact the seller but didn’t get a response.Edit UPDATE: Seller actually did respond and will be sending a brand new item free of charge.
","
Awesome! Just plug in & charge super serious! Nice to be cords-free!!
","
i absolutely love this charger its easy to use AND it lets you know when its charging by changing from green to blue and it blinks green if its not compatible with a device . i use this for my iphone 11 pro max and airpods pro ! its a must buy !!!
","
This is thin and light and I'm addicted! I put my husband's bright phone face down (he has to keep it on through the night) and I put this solid wireless charger over it and it charges perfectly WITHOUT shining in my face at all through the night anymore.
","
So far works great, does exactly what I need it to do. Also looks great on my desk.
","
Works perfectly with  iphone and Samsung phones.
","
Compact, sleek and nonslip. Works for me!
","
This doodad is the coolest thing. You just plop your phone (has to be iPhone 8 or newer folks) and bam, it starts charging. The charging cable is a USB-C cable. That is a big plus. I plugged it to the back of my desktop in one of the USB ports so that I can charge whatever needs it.
","
you can charge your phone with your case and using this charger, as long as you don’t have a pop socket, handle or etc. attached to your phone case.The case works great, looks nice and does not take up a lot of space.
","
We tried this out with 4 different phone cases and it works great! I even have two cards in the back of my phone case and I don’t have a problem. I was asked to get a few more for around the house because of how convenient they are
","
The product is good and so far has worked well.
","
Very easy to use and now bought for more family
","
The product came in less that 24 hours, feels expensive, would be a great gift for a cheap price bc it feels like it would cost more than it does. Perfect for my desk at work during the day.
","
This slim, compact design easily fits on my desk and gives me ready access to a charger. This works great and is very fast at charging my phone and my headphones. I plan on buying more of these to use elsewhere in my home.
","
Do I still have it, yes. If I could go back in time would I still purchase it, definitely not.It does the job... most of the time. The lights are cool, they were the selling point for me BUT they never turn off and the brightness is somewhat annoying. What's worse is sometimes they like to flash, randomly, in the middle of the night. Finally, you have to aline your phone just right, 1 centimeter to the side and it stops charging
","
Fantastic wireless charging pad for a good price. I use this pad to charge my various devices, including my Samsung Galaxy, my work iPhone, and my Tozo Bluetooth ear buds. Wirless pad is extremely fast charging!! Tozo makes great products and you can't go wrong.
","
This charger works best on my iPhone 12. Better than the Apple charger. If I use this one my battery lasts all day versus with the apple by battery dies super fast.
","
I have only had it a few hours, but I have already charged my Tozo T10 ear buds and my iPhone X.  no fuss, no muss, no lie - I like it a lot.  Can't respond yet to how it will be for traveling, but it should be simple to pack and use on trips.
","
Excelente producto lo recomiendo fácil de usar y muy pequeño ligero para transportar llego antes de lo que esperaba
","
Had to buy this, thought it was included with the ear-buds... but it wasn't... charges the earbuds great, but certainly won't charge my samsung phone... it's all good but not what I expected from the description.
","
it seems like a well made quality product. Slim design with a luxurious feel. I bought 2 so far. The light indicator is intuitive and easy. Blue light for a good positioning of the phone and green for a full charge. The led light has the right amount of intensity. I use these wireless chargers with iphone 11 and iphone X and no issues so far. Highly recommend
","
I haven't had it for long but so far its pretty good
","
These work well charging my iPhone even with the case on it. I don’t know how fast they charge because I put the phone on it overnight and it’s charged the next morning.
","
Good for the price.
","
I've tried at least 3 times to use this charger and it does not charge my Android phone
","
It makes a sound when nothing is on it sometimes. It can be a litttle annoying if you are trying to sleep with it. But since my phone is on it when I sleep it rarely bothers me. This could be corrected in my opinion.
","
This charger was purchased with the TOZO wireless headphones which has worked out great. The slick design works well with my hallway table for design and accessibility for my headphones. I leave them on charge as soon as I walk in and grab them once I leave the house. Another cool feature is that it charges my Iphone which i was unware of. Great for guests who forget their chargers.
","
This is a well constructed very flat thin charger. A little large but has a nice rubberized top. There is a bright green light on all the time except when it is charging. The charging time seems to be good as expected.
","
I bought two of these products, one for my kitchen and one for my desk at work. Both are extremely nice! In both locations, I am constantly on and off the phone or leaving my desk--and not having my phone constantly charging via a cord, makes life a lot easier. The design is very slim and visually appealing. 5 - star product...have had no issues with it  at all.
","




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I really enjoy this pads  the color changes once it’s on charge .The design in general is very nice and it does charge just as vast as any other charger but much more convenient and you don’t have to worry about Constantly bring out the bringing cord.I made a video about question about the USB I hope this helps.
","
This is just what I needed when I need another one I will be buying another one of these.  Thank you highly recommend this he seller fast shipping too.
","
The wireless charger looks amazing, just as it's pictured. In addition, it's even thinner than I perceived, and it works flawlessly so far. My favorite feature is the unique lighting that indicates the charging status. The lighting is bright enough to see in full sunlight but can be covered by your phone if you want to use it on a nightstand while you sleep. Overall a great product at a great price.
","
I originally just bought one of these but after loving it so much I have come back two more times to buy more of them... It it a great charger!  I have one on my home workstation, home office, work office, and one beside my bed.  Charges both my wife's iPhone and a my Samsung.  Can't be happier with it!
","
This charger works really well and looks great - love it and ordered another for my workplace.
","
This product is easy to use and works well. I love the fact you don’t need to plug the phone in. It feels solid and the material feels of good quality. I would highly recommend this product. It even charges through the phone case.
","
This phone charger is not only a great technical product it is absolutely beautiful! It's been a long time since I found a piece of equipment like this. I enjoy looking it as much as I like using.
","
Great for traveling with and simple to use
","
Supet easy set-up. Nice packaging. Plugged it in and set my lg thinq7 down and it immediately started charging and said 2hrs 20 minutes till fully charged. This was from 15%. Also charging through 4 credit cards in a plastic sleeve  on the back of the phone case.
","
I received it just today and it is working perfectly. Hopefully it keeps up like this. I love the color and sleek design. It is not clunky and I don't have to hunt around for the charger cable.
","
The Tozo Ultra Thin is the intersection of low profile and modern look. It features a perimeter light that changes from green (not charging but available) to blue (charging) that are bright enough to be seen across a small room but subtle enough to go unnoticed on a nightstand while you're sleeping. It effectively charges my devices. It was a good buying choice and well worth the modest price.
","
For what this costs how can it not be a 5 star item. Plug it in a USB port and it works. As simple as that.
","
This charger is great! My cord chargers kept breaking so I was in the market for a wireless charger. It has made it so much easier and will be worth it in the long run. The only down fall is that one of the chargers is a bit touchy (I purchased 2). You have to line it up just right. The other one is less touchy. Overall I'd recommend.
","
Works as advertised, the lights are a very nice touch!
","
Very easy to set up. Clean design. Lightweight and compact (it’s a little bigger than the palm of a hand). It seems to charge iPhone XS/Samsung Galaxy phones at approximately 1% per minute. Phone doesn’t get hot while charging, neither does the cord/charging plate. The only con is that it cannot charge when the phone has a thicker case on (like the otterbox ones). It works perfectly fine with slim cases.
","
The charger itself is fine, but be careful that your case doesn’t have a bump or a holder or something on the back side preventing it from laying flat and making the sufficient connection to charge it.
","
it looks slim and easy to handle, but it is a very slow charger and very sensitive to connect with the phone
","
This little charger is compact and sturdy. I bought it for my son to charge his earbuds. He loves it, and when he's not using my husband or I are placing our phones on it for some extra juice.
","
Its a really good product but the charging cable type C it really short i wish it was longer it was like 6 inches long i recomend investing a longer cable and plus but another wall adapter for it
","
Love the feel, look, and portability of it but i just feel like it charges really slow
","
Just started using it for my work desk. It looks great. I have the white with silver rim. Very elegant yet chargers my phone quite quickly. I like the fact that you can apply for the one year extended warranty. I recommend this product.
","
No better value for an off brand wireless charger… Absolutely no complaints on the price. Highly recommend!
","
Love this wireless charger - I actually bought a 2nd one for a different room in my apartment. Customer service replied very quickly and sent me a replacement when I had issues with my 2nd charger.
","
Excellent low price charger. This one works a lot better than any of the other ones I’ve tried I really recommend it
","
Doesn’t seem to charge my phone. It holds the charge where it is through the day but doesn’t seem to charge it.  Maybe if I left it and not used my phone throughout the day and let it sit for hours without ever turning on the display.
","
I’ve only had them for a couple of days but they charge both my iPhones and AirPods Pro well. They appear to shut off (LED lights change back to blue) when the phones are full charged. Doesn’t seem to do the same for AirPods but not sure that is an issue.
","
It’s great for my iPhone 8s and I use it with an iPhone brick so no issues there. It’s fast and powerful. If I’m not using it I do unplug it as the green light stays on but that’s the only thing I would change. It lights a beautiful blue when charging and green when phone is charged or nothing is on it. Overall, it work great!
","
I like the size, charge speed and the indicator light that shows something is charging and when it was done. Sometimes I have to get my iPhone 8 Plus to line up to get it charging. I use it with my TOZO 6 headset and it works great for that too. The grips on the bottom are also great for keeping it from sliding off the counter.
","
It's a little slow but otherwise works well.
","
I've used a few wireless chargers before. This one works great, haven't had any trouble with it yet. You will need to pair it with a good charging brick though. I tried using a charging brick that came with another one of my wireless chargers and it did not charge as quick. Once I switched the brick with one of my Samsung black chargers, it worked perfectly.
","
This is a very sleek looking wireless charger that comes without the AC adapter.  That said, plugged into a Samsung fast charger block, the unit lights up with led indicators as if it is going to work but my Samsung s20 ultra tells me it cannot use this type of fast charger and will have to charge at slow speeds.  I should have just bought a Samsung.
","
The charge is hit or miss. One night it will charge to 100%. The other times it will randomly stop charging, even when I make sure to look at my phone to see if it’s charging before I walk away from the charger. I have tried charging it with and without the phone case, nothing makes a difference. You are paying for what you get.
","
Charging is fairly slow as with all wireless chargers, but I really do like the sleek design. Its extremely portable and charges my iphone perfectly fine with an otterbox case on. Would definitely recommend especially for the price.
","
The Charger works as advertised. my wife's only issue is the light is very bright. She will disconnect it in the middle of the night because the room has to be pitch black. I'm just going to cover it with some tape.
","
Literally a 'plug-in and use immediately' product. Very happy with the slim design and ease of use.Only downside is that it does seem to get a bit hot when charging my phone overnight but otherwise, it's a great product... especially at this low price-point. Would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable wireless charger.
","
The charger is very slim and the lights give it a nice modern look. I like how the lights change depending on if it’s charging your phone or on standby. The fact that it also comes with a 1 year warranty gives me some reassurance.
","
I just switched my phone to i phone SE 2nd generation, so I wanted to try to use wireless charger.I am glad to bought this charger. It works good even with my phone case.Also I like this stylish looks too.
","
So far I love my new charger it charged my Tozo ear buds case fast. I love the color I chose.  I so far gave this a 5 star rating,but will update once I use it for a few more days.
","
Charges very fast and very easy to use
","
I’ve had this for a week and I love it! Got a 6 ft USB-C cord so it sits perfectly by my bed and I don’t have to worry about finding the charging cable and hooking it up when I go to bed at night. I love that the light changes color when your phone is done charging. The charger is also very pretty and sleek! I highly recommend it!
","
This worked great but only lasted less than a year, randomly it decided to stop charging my phone. I would put the phone down on the charger and it would turn blue for about 5-10 seconds and then flash green and stop charging. I tried everything, unplugging it and restarting my phone multiple times. I tried to process a warranty and because I didn’t have an order number I couldn’t. I am hoping for any advice on how to fix this issue because I really did like the charger.
","
Finally a wireless charger that works through my wallet case and 3 cards! Power in does not equal power out,  but it gets close to 10w using the factory Samsung charger that came with my note 9. It works MUCH better than the other 2 wireless chargers I own.
","
a good charger, works as described, but i have a larger case that holds multiple cards and i have to take it off for my phone to charge.
","
My son took my old one so I reordered because I liked it so much. I mainly use it for charging my Bluetooth cases for ear buds. Very handy.
","
Works well most of the time.  I guess what I really should say is it is user error for not making sure the phone is on correct and charging before I walk away.
","
Great product, you’ll need a brick to attach the charging cord.
","
Great product just wished it came with an adapter.
","
Silly cheap, does what it says, wireless inductive charging.  Also does what it doesn’t say, emits barely audible high pitched noises.  Would love the first without the second.  Maybe they all do that, I’m just a random dude on Amazon, not an expert.
","
It's nice and sleek/thin and not so obvious on my desk. My main reason for getting it is I can change my phone with the case on. My other one didn't let me do that.
","
Very nice looking wireless charger. Nice and light weight, great for travel. It works in fast wireless charging mode for my Galaxy S7 Edge, S9+, and iPhone 11.  Works great with all of my true wireless earbuds too.  Exactly the wireless charger I want at a fantastic price. The light indicator blinks to let me know when it's charging.  Highly recommending this charger to everyone.
","
I originally gave a 1 star review because the charger didn't work on my iPhone 11, so returned the item. But after doing some online research, it looks like apple has some software issues regarding the charging pads; sometimes their phones stop working with them. In my case I rebooted the phone and the phone charging started working again.
","
Fantastic Wireless Charger - Very Thin and Great Looking with great selection of color options. Be sure to use the proper quick charging Wall adapter (5V / 2A) and it will work like a dream. Highly Recommend this product !
","
Just opened & used this today (9/13/20) & seems to be a solid wireless charger so far. Just plug the c-type charging cord it comes with into the wireless charger & set your phone, etc on the base of the wireless charger & watch it charge instantly. I’d recommend for sure.
","
Charging power not good.
","
**UPDATE ****** stopped working a month out of the return window. Disappointing-do not recommend.I have no complaints other than I wished I had realized how bright the charging device is allNight long. Even when fully charged it doesn’t “turn off”- the green light still glows bright all night long. If light doesn’t bother you when trying to sleep then it’s not a big deal. Also doesn’t  come w an adapter. Design is nice, slim & sleek, compact size and nice pads on base. Green color matches my iPhone but again it’s under the base so only the white really shows, but still a nice color match if you like that sort of thing.
","
The color that arrived is a very yellow tan, not at all like the buff color pictured.
","
So far I love this charger!  It changes my Tozo earbuds or my iphone 8 in no time.  LED colors make it easy to tell when charging, green or purple.  It has no skid strips on bottom to help keep it in position on desk or table.  I didn't mind that it doesn't come with the ac wall block, we have those everywhere.
","
The charger works very well with my iPhone and my husband’s android phone. It charges relative quick and I kept it by my bed side so the it will charge overnight! No more finding plug in cords just put your phone down!
","
I bought this for myself. When I received it it was not working properly I contacted the seller and they immediately offered to send me a replacement. The customer service was excellent and I will update my review when the new one is received.
","
I put my phone on this at night, it changes color so I know it’s charging, but it never completes a full charge. Usually about 60% in the morning. It’s very frustrating. I’ve already missed the return window or I’d send it back.  I got the champagne color, it’s very pretty as far as chargers go, but that’s the end of its awesomeness.
","
Easy to get the phone charging. Where others I’ve had you need to find the sweet spot to start charging, this one starts charging every time.
","
Bought this for my daughter . She was complaining that her iPhone wasn’t charging properly with the wire. This was a great alternative to spending a grand on another . It charges well and completely.
","
None
","
Looks and works very nice. The lights on the top are pretty cool and let me know when the phone is charging and when it is charged. Very sturdy and appealing design. Built like an iPhone with solid aluminum. Very pleased.
","
Pleasantly surprised by the quality. I ordered these in gold and black. The gold is more of a rose gold and matches the iPhone 8 gold perfectly. Powerful enough to charge with a pretty thick case on the phone. So for they work perfectly.
","
Was a great device shipping was quick and product is awesome.
","
The BEST Wireless charger ever!  I bought an expensive name brand Wireless charger 3 years ago that didn't charge through a case.I can charge through my sup case.  Buy this charger.  Works great on Android phones.
","
I had been looking for a wireless charger for a while. I came across this one just recently and so far I’m loving it. It charges my phone pretty good, it looks nice, it’s affordable and it hasn’t had any problems.
","
I just got it today, but it works! I cant make any comments about reliability or longevity, but it comes with a shorter cable, i was able to get it on my desk and connect to a port on the floor, but dont expect to have it super far from a port without a longer cable.
","
I like how shiny and the quality looked, it’s didn’t feel like cheap plastic. The charge is decent, only thing i wish it did was charge my Apple Watch. It works perfect for iPhone and AirPods
","
For simple and easy wireless charging, this is an affordable and seemingly well-constructed charger.  Charged my iPhone in a reasonable amount of time!  The LEDs are very useful to know when its placed correctly, so there's no guesswork when placing a phone on the charger.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
","
I like the thin size and wide footprint of this charger.  My phone seems more stable laying on it than others I have used.  It’s also attractive sitting on my desk and nightstand(bought 2 of them)
","
I mainly bought this charger to charge my Galaxy Buds, and they did not disappoint! The charging power and speed of this charger is impeccable, and for this amazing price, it's nearly unbeatable with all of the different colors!
","
Works great right out of the box and no issues with phone sliding off during charging.Other manufactures should take some notes because wireless chargers should be this easy.I tried two other chargers and this one by far surpasses their usability.Highly Recommended !!
","
With a LG power supply, getting 1.6A to my iPhome 11pro. Looks good, like a unobtrusive coaster. Note: I have the plain grey model, it does not light up like the other colors.
","
I love the slim design and charge indicator lights. The go from warm green when ready to charge to a gentle blue while charging. It charges my iPhone 11 ProMax from 50% to 90% in a couple of hours while I'm at my desk each day, keeping my battery at optimum health. Intermittent use is much easier now; I don't have to unplug when I go for a stroll.
","
Not the fastest charger in the world but probably on par with most other wireless phone chargers. Very convenient to use for multiple devices. Great value.
","
I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. Slim, and large area charging pad. Nice lights for when your dead asleep and your phone goes off, you look at it and then go to put it back. Let's you know its charging and its great for traveling.
","
Sleek. Beautiful. Thin. Looks really sturdy. Surprised it doesn't cost more.It is always lit green when plugged in and ready to go. Turns blue when charging. It would be nice if the green could be turned off and only be lit when charging. It is like having a night light on :-)
","
This charger does the trick! It sleek, and works great to charge all my wireless charging devices.  I wanted to have it for a while before writing a review...and after a month of use...I LOVE IT!
","
I used this charger for the first time last night. It was so easy to use and charged my wireless earbuds quickly. So far I love it! The color is nice too. I got the rose gold.
","
Super slim profile. Works exactly as advertised -- charges quickly with the right power source (probably 12w+) and looks great on my office desk. The always-on green light isn't too bright. I don't use it in a bedroom, but I don't think it'd be much of a distraction in that application. This little charger has been a great purchase and I'm glad I pulled the trigger.
","
I seem to never learn my lesson.  I have a box full of Amazon highly rated electronics that may last a few weeks or months before they just break or stop working.  I was hopeful this would be a well thought out product as the packaging showed some detail.  That's as far as it got.  The charger pad itself seems nice, but there's a connection issue.  It's either in the cable end or the port receptacle.  It's very loos and I have to fidget with it to get it to stay connected.  Once I get it powered on, I have to gently place my phone down to keep from it moving and the cable disconnecting.  This was my experience after the first single use.  Yeah, I probably just need to return it.  Unless I got a lemon, this was designed very poorly.  It might be worth paying more for a name brand charger.
","
Update:I returned this charger. It worked but it would not fast charge my Samsung Galaxy S20+. Initially when I placed the phone on the charger it would show fast charging but after 2 or 3 seconds it would change to a regular charge. I tried different adapters, charge cords, and even removed my phone case. I could not maintain a fast charge. If that's not a feature you need or want then this would probably work great for you.Original review:I just received this charger and it seems to work as expected. I also purchased the Tozo T12 wireless earbuds and so far I'm impressed with their products. I will update my review if any problems arise.
","
Attractive and easy to use wireless charger. Purchased for my wife, liked that it matched her iPhone and had gold as a color option. The gold, to my eyes, is more rose than yellow, but that’s fine it still looks beautiful, as chargers go.
","
I love the design of this charger! It is sleek and doesn’t add a lot of extra to my nightstand. I will definitely be purchasing one for my husband!! If you’re thinking about buying it, DO IT!
","
Not happy with this product. Did not fully charge my phone.
","
This is my first ever wireless charger and I made the right choice! I bought this for my mine and my husbands TOZO wireless headphones and we love it! It also charges our iPhones which is pretty cool. I love that I don’t have to hunt down a charging cord to charge my headphones.
","
Slim design is very nice and portable. Royal blue didn't have lights on the top that could possibly keep you awake in dark bedroom. Overall, seems to be a great product. Very slim and seems to work well. USB c cable included, but would need a plug/adapter. Phone was possibly slightly warmer than after charging with OEM Samsung fast chargers, but any fast charger will warm up the device a bit.
","
The charger does an excellent job charging my phone. It lights up to indicate that it is on and when it charges. The light is also not super flashy or bright so it doesn't keep me awake but still looks super sleek. I have found that depending how thick your phone case is you may have to take it out to charge but all in all pretty sick!
","
My first time purchasing a wireless charger and this thing is amazing!!! I don’t know why I’m just now introducing this product into my life after 10 years of owning an iPhone. It’s very sleek, thin, portable, small, convenient  and all around terrific. My favorite feature are the lights that indicated when charging (blue) and plugged in (green). This product is phenomenal - you won’t regret purchasing it.
","
I love this charger! So sleek and thin it works amazing! I highly recommend this charger
","
Device works great with my iPhone X. Be sure to use a 5V 2A power adapter (not the same 1V adapter that comes with most standard charging cables) to get a sufficient charge. Glows blue while charging then switches to green when fully charged.
","
This product is absolutely amazing. It arrived quickly. It has a sleek, modern look and I love that it isn’t bulky. It charges me iPhone perfectly fine and I absolutely love Tozo. I have several of their products.
","
anyways its was good ig
","
Nice small profile on my bed stand. You can rotate the base so that the phone will cover the bright green lights. Also you need to line up the phone just right to get the recharging to engage. Easy to do, just get in the habit.
","
Love how compact it is! Also great that it just stays magnetically on my phone while I use it since my normal charging port is broken on my phone. Saved my life.
","
Works perfect. Fast charging. Better than any other I have tried. I would love it if the lights didn't have to be on all the time just for appearance, though I'm sure they are very low power LED of course. Looks really good with my other Mac equipment. Hope it will last for a long time. So far performance is perfect and easy to use.
","
Fantastic design, glass top with metal frame, charges a bit slower than a cord but it doesn’t matter to me because I use it while I’m playing games at my desk, I set it down on the charger every time I put my phone down.
","
Easy to use.
","
Super sleek and thin design. Love the color indicator. Photo showing green when ready for item to charge and blue when the item is charged and ready as in the photo with my new wireless airbuds fully charged
","
I have had the earlier version from Tozo. The W6 is Ultra slim but ""packs a punch"". I recently got slim NC7 Earbuds and they function seamlessly. Suits my on the go lifestyle.
","
This is little device is so handy. Just quickly place your iPhone on the pad, the light turns from green to blue, and just like that, it starts charging. Charging is fast, and I throw my device on it several times a day. So handy and convenient!
","
I have an iPhone XR and it works with the charger but it takes a long time to charge, also, you have to place it correctly or otherwise it won’t charge at all.
","
I like that different phones can be charged.  If I can just keep my cat from bumping it and moving it enough to stop the charging...  ugh
","
Easy to use and super cute. I use it for my head phones and have never had any problems with anything.
","
Great value, would be great if charging was faster. Over all, its good.
","
I like the lights on it. It is also very sleek
","
Worked right out of the box, but charged fairly slowly...
","
Heated up the phone...had to stop using, the company came through and offered a new product or an amazon gc
","
Like the flat, low profile. Easy to use. Good charging power.
","
This is a very awesome price and a great product. It is cheap but strong and won’t let you down.  I have had it for a day now and it works great. Can’t complain.
","
I have been using this product for a month and it has been fully functional. It works well, even in the car. My Samsung phone charges quickly and completely.
","
Love this device! It is thin and charges well. I don't have to fumble around for the right cord when charging between my iPhone and Galaxy Note and it charges through my phone cases. It isn't as fast as plugging directly into the cable but it is pretty close. I use it to charge my iPhone 8 Plus, Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy Buds. I will definitely purchase more!
","
Love the sleek design. Went with white to fit my room aesthetic and it’s so low profile, I almost forget it’s there! Love the built in LED indicator, makes it easy to find in the dark. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
","
I was upset it’s only for IPhone charging when I searched for the item I typed wireless charging for android
","
This is a great wireless charger. The price was right and it charges my iPhone 12 Pro (with case) and my TOZO NC9 wireless earbuds without any issues. It also looks sleek and modern. Nice product!
","
Works  great. I'm using it since the charge port on my iphoneX is wearing out.
","
Love it! So convenient!
","
It's a amazing wireless charger I ever used before, I can charge my I phone earbuds easily and safely. It help me to avoid wire connection to my I phone  while charging. It's perfect for daily uses.
","
This is an extremely finicky wireless charger. Phones need to be placed at the EXACT right position in order to charge; this morning I gave up attempting to charge my Nexus 5 after placing and replacing it for at least 30 seconds without success. Once you do get it working, it charges just fine; but given that the attraction of a wireless charger is supposed to be the ease of use, this is much more of a pain to use than just plugging in a cable. I would only suggest considering this if your phone has a broken USB port and absolutely cannot charge any other way - and even so, buy a different wireless charger that works much more reliably.
","
I have bought several . Had one faulty charging cable and the whole unit is being replaced. Good customer service
","
Easy to useWorks with Otterbox great product!
","
I love this charging pad because its so convenient. I don't have to become tangled in cords and its easy to keep on my desk. It charges your phone as fast as any other charger. The slim, shiny design is very modern and aesthetically pleasing. Its size makes it good for travel as well. I can't wait to get more use out of this product. Highly recommended!
","
This charger is great and for a price to fit any pocket. It not only charges the wireless earbuds I bout it for, but the families phones as well. Sleek design, love the light indicators on it also. Well worth the money. Will update later if needed.
","
I so wanted to love this, but I don’t. It’s pretty and when unplugged looks really nice on my nightstand... until it’s plugged in and two strips of bright green light shine forth. When your phone is charging it changes to blue, which is fine until you turn the lights off and a bright blue glow fills the room. I ended up using it for a few nights covered by some clothes but at that point it just got to be more work than it was worth, especially since it charged inconsistently through my phone case. I don’t know why it has to stay lit even when not in use, seems like a waste of electricity to me. If I had a desk job and wanted to charge it during the day this would be fine, but that’s not my intended use.
","
What I liked about this product was the super fast charging capabilities that this charger has. It got me from 20% up to 100% so quickly. Especially before I left to work (required to have my phone on me 24/7). So it got it done within that time frame, which my old charger could never.
","
This product did not work for my iphone 7 plus, even though it clearly stated in the description that it was compatiblle.  When I asked the support team of this product - they were not helpful, therefore I had to return this product.
","
I was looking for a charger that I was able to use with my phone case on. I have a lifeproof case on my iPhone. This charger was exactly what I was looking for, easy to use, lightweight to travel, I can charge it with my case on. It also looks very nice!!
","
Incredibly thin, light, and works great!  Easy to charge quickly.  The USB-C port is an added bonus.  Be sure to plug the cable into a wall port, charging brick, or computer directly, not into a USB hub so that it receives sufficient power.
","
This is a great charger if you have the phone lined up correctly, but if not you think it's charging, but low and behold it's not.  I have several and the one in the common area of the house it's not an issue because you plop it down make sure it's charging and there you go.  I also have one by my bed, but the issue there is that if you bump it during the night or you pick up your phone and put it back chances are it won't be lined up.  Many times I've woken up the next day and the phones not charged. Particularly since I switched cases to a otterbox commuter case.  I found another wireless charger where no matter where I drop it it charges AND it's made from a rubbery material so it's less likely to slide/spin around and not get charged.
","
Easy to use
","
I am satisfied with this charger easy to use epically the LED indicator letting me know the phone is charging. Yes, the phone also will show an indication. but a simple glance at the charger is useful from across the room.
","
Nice product but did not charge fast enough for me. Tozo was very understanding of my concern and was willing to replace my defective chargers for free or provide a gift card for customer satisfaction.
","
Looks good and is light and doesn't take up too much space. When I tried to register it for the warranty, it wouldn't take it because I have another tozo product that is registered under that email. So I contacted them thru email and they have not answered me yet. Sooo not too crazy about that. The product itself works most of the time. But sometimes it stops charging and that is very annoying. You put it on the charger when going to bed and 7 hours later, it's only at 70 or so percent. Trying to see if it may be user error and waiting to see if they get back to me about registering the product. If neither, then it's going back. It needs to work all the time. Also, got the blue one and it doesn't have the nice shiny top that the other colors have.EDIT: Ended up sending it back... Too unreliable.
","
Bought this for work. used 3 times in a three day span just shocked me and now is dead .
","
It's a beautifully made charger. It's thin, sleek, and solid. Your phone will cover up the lights but not AirPods. They have one that doesn't have large charging indicator lights if it does bother you. It works great and charges through my phone case. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I recommend it. It comes with a Type C cord but not an AC adapter.
","
Are use it for my iPhone it works great
","
After looking through Amazon for a long time this is hands-down the best functioning, slimmest and most modern looking one you will find.It looks beautiful on our nightstand, and the lights are so clear as to whether it’s powered on and or charging.Lots of choices in colors also so you can get the one that best fits wherever you’re putting it.Brilliant!
","
Love wireless charging on the new iPhones - no more faulty charging ports!The Tozo charger works fine so far. The size and design is the best part. It looks like it was designed by Apple. All the other wireless chargers on Amazon look pretty bland, and are around the same price as this one.
","
Very light weight and easy to use, completely match my expectation. It will take 3 times longer to charge then the plugin, but it's expected.
","
The Charging cable end that plugs into the charger is too big for the charger. It works, but the connector hangs out by 1/4 which causes it to slide out easily, losing charge. What truly makes this product rubbish is that the device is finicky. I need to unplug the connector and replug it in right before I want to charge my phone... making sure the lights are on. Once it’s operational, I have to slide my phone around until my phone makes the charging sound/icon appear. However, I only have one chance per unplug/replug. If I slide it too far (makes charging notification then stops), I can’t slide it back to the correct spot— I need to replug it. The charging area is also kind of awkward as it only charges on the bottom 1/3 of my phone, not in the center. If the phone moves off the designated area or the loose connector falls out slightly, I have to do the process all over again. I can only imagine the connector is why people lose charge randomly. Anyway, it’s more frustrating than not.I’m using an iPhone 11, it doesn’t work for my iPad Pro, it also doesn’t work for my Apple Watch series 3 (not that it was advertised to).
","
Won't charge my samsung note 20 ultra. LED flashed green. Try it on my Bro-in-law S21 ultra and it charged. LED show solid blue when the phone show charge. Gave it to him since it doesn't work on my note 20 ultra.
","
I just received this today but I am already so obsessed, I had to write a review immediately. This charger is so sleek looking that it looks great on any counter and I love anything in rose gold so I was really excited to see it came in that color! What's even better is that it also charges my Tozo wireless earbuds, by placing the case on here.
","
This is super easy to use and set up. The signal lights for charging are a good brightness where they don't illuminate a room while you sleep, but are bright enough to show when the phone is properly on the charger. The gold finish with the white pad makes for a sleek look. The compactness of the charger makes it really easy for travel use as well.
","
picks up charge easily through my otterbox case. Way better then the magsafe chargers that verizon offers
","
Needs special adapter to enable fast wireless charging. Takes forever to charge without fast charging. Not included.
","
Easy to use...works on iPhone 8plus with a Lifeproof case on it. It does take longer to charge than a regular charger but when you put your phone on it at night, you’ll wake up in the morning with full battery
","
Wow...I love this charger.  It is so compact. The light on it is barely noticeable.  The only thing about it that I struggle with is, I have it on the end table next to the couch and sometimes I want to put my drink on it thinking it is a coaster....
","
I always fall asleep with out plugging in my phone to charge so it wouldn’t be charged in the morning. This has absolutely solved that issue for me! I just set my phone on top and it charges!!! It’s really good charging and it’s small so it’s perfect for travel too!!!
","
Like a laptop charger
","
Great quality and it works fine.
","
I had this wireless charger for 3 days now, I love how slim it is and it looks so modern, the charging is good, it charges my Pixel 5 fast, I like it and I recommend itTOZO customer service is awesome, very professional, and friendly.

It charges things quickly and it is so nice not to have to bend down and plug in a charger, I just lay my earbuds on it and go.

I’m very happy 👍🏻👍🏻

I just got it today and I really like it, the lights around it are really cool. I got the black version and I love it already. I consider it to be a great purchase if you’re looking for a wireless charger.

I wasn't sure if it was a good purchase or not, but definitely it is. It looks cool af, it is extremely thin and it works the way it should.

Very handy
","
If not placed on the pad correctly it won’t charge .
","
This wireless charger is a great value for the money. It takes away the aggravation of trying to find the charging port in the dark when I’m tired and ready to go to bed. It connects easily and charges fast. I would recommend.

Nice charger!  It is easy to use and works well with my wireless headphone case and my iPhone. Remember to buy a USB-C box unless you want to use it with your laptop. For this price, you can’t beat it!
","
The charger looks sleek and beautiful. It is easy to use - It comes with an USB cord and I just plug it into my own adapter. Love the LED indicator that shows when it is ready to charge and when it is charging.
","
This charger works well but it is not as fast as a plug in charger.
","
I like the convenience of not having to look for the port to plug in my phone—just lay it down and it it charged when I come back.  The lights stay on til I unplug it which first irritated me but now it is a reminder to unplug and not waste energy.
","
I'm really impressed by how thin this charger is and how quick it charges. Great to use on my night stand, no more cable laying around looking messy. I plan on purchasing another one to use on my desk at work.
","
This is my first wireless charger. Easy to use, provides a good charge.
","
This charger was exactly what I was looking for! It’s lightweight and matches my wife’s “rose gold” theme on her night stand lol. The only con would be the lights that are on the surface but you can cover them with the phone while it charges so it really not a big deal. I would definitely recommend though!
","
Easy to use, space saving and convenient.
","
Does not charge unless your phone is in the “perfect” spot. Does not charge through phone case like my other wireless charger. Totally disappointed in these item.
","
Looks nice, lights all work, looks like it's charging but 2 hours later phone hasn't charged up even 1% (phone even says it's charging).
","
Pink is very cute and works perfectly for charging my phone and AirPods at work!
","
Nice for my husband to just lay his phone down at night. Seems to work really well.
","
This charger is much smaller than other manufactures making it easy to find space for it or store for travel. Its a quality product that works great. I have purchased other TOZO products and have always been impressed with the quality.
","
Works good. Fast charging! Very easy to use. Very well made, it feels solid. Another thing I love about this is the lights don’t show while charging.  I don’t loose sleep because of the lights.
","
I love this product. Needed a new charger and thought I'd just get a wireless one. This one seemed less clunky than all the others I was looking at. It is a beautiful rose gold and I imagine I'll be using it for awhile
","
I plugged it in and it worked! I set my phone on it and connect from my PC with the remote to android tool (Microsoft I think).
","
Though this doesn't charge as quickly as I would like, it's a perfect option for my TOZO T6 earbuds and short charges for my cell phone. As a side bonus, it looks really attractive on my desk in the office.

 I loved this
","
Bought 5 for myself and my employees. They look great and work well. Charging times vary by phone but these seem to charge all of our iPhones pretty quickly. No complaints whatsoever here!
","
Great product!  Charging pad is super thin and works well with my iPhone and bluetooth earphone in their case.  I love how it lights up blue when charging and stays green when not charging.  Will buy few more for rest of the family!
","
Home
","
Easy to use
","
This is an excellent wireless charger! It has a sleek design and is more reliable than other wireless chargers I’ve had. It charges through the phone case, and you don't have to have the phone in ""just the right place"" to get it to work. It has a blue light to show it is charging and a green light when charging is complete.  Great value! Highly recommend!
","
I bought this wireless charger as I wanted something small that I could take with me. The Rose Gold color is beautiful. Once plugged into an AC adapter it is ready to go! I would definitely recommend this product.
","
Easy set up and sleek look. I keep going through corded chargers and have found the answer. Now I want to get one for every room in the house. Hoping it will last because I’m tired of throwing out chargers and creating waste. If it holds up I will definitely be buying more
","
If you have the TOZO earbuds, you definitely need this wireless charger. Yes, you can change your earbuds with the provided cord, but this just makes it so much easier. For the price, it’s a no brained!
","
It is very sleek and charges well!
","
It’s very easy to use and it’s sleek design doesn’t clash with the room but I expected it to charge a little bit faster than it does.
","
This is a beautiful item to have on a desk or bedside table. It's small and easy to use and works great!I would recommend this to anyone in need of a new wireless charger.
","
It doesn’t charge right away.  I have to keep moving my phone around for it to make connection.
","
I really like the charger. I plugged it in and it came on, placed my phone on it and it charged quickly. The light did not bother my sleep at all. The phone did feel warm when I picked it up. My daughter had one and told me to try it. I am glad I did. So much easier than the cord charger. Thank you for a great product.
","
I am using it with Tozo C1 20 W super charger and I couldn’t be more happy, charging really fast! And works perfectly with the case on my phone!
","
Stopped working after 3 months
","
Very thin and extremely quiet, looks really great and seems to be made of good quality materials. I used a fast charging adapter and the charging didn’t seem to be that fast, but maybe that is just to be expected from wireless charging. Overall, though, great wireless charger for the price.
","
This charger is frustrating. When placing your phone on it, you have to get it just right for it to charge. I find myself scooting my phone around over and over again until it hits the right spot.It is also not fast charging and feels like it takes forever.
","
It’s nice, but charges slow
","
Flase advertisement.  Not a fast wireless charger sof Samsung S22 ultra.  Initially, it'll say fast charging, then I get the attached notification that it switched yo regular charging.  My S22 ultra is able to fast charge from oem wireless charger fine. I'm using a power adapter that can go upto 60W.
","
I appreciate the thought and ingenuity that went into making this wireless charger. I am a happy and proud owner.
","
I bought the Tozo wireless charger made out of aluminum and absolutely love it. It's super convenient to charge my phone and my awesome new Tozo wireless earbuds that I bought at the same time. I'm considering buying another one for work and possibly another set of earbuds so I never accidentally leave them at home because once you're free of the wires you'll never want to go back. So Awesome!
","
Very easy, just plug and play.
","
This charges VERY slowly. Even if your phone is in airplane mode it takes probably 10 times slower than a regular charger.Not bad to just have placed somewhere like an office where you can just have it sitting on there all day.
","
First of all, I love this because it looks really elegant and pretty on my side table (I got the rose gold one)! lol but overall, this is such a great product! 10/10 recommended! I have magnets in my iphone case, and it still charged!
","
I purchased this with my T12 wireless earbuds, but was hopefully it would work with my Pixel 3 too. It does! It is literally a plug and go set up which is great! The design is very sleek so it always looks ""in place"" where ever you put it. My first, but not my last, TOZO purchase.
","
Easy to use.
","
Very simple to set up. Works well.
","
This is the 2nd wireless Qi charger I have. This one is very thin and has a sleep friendly light for the bedroom. Much less than my previous wireless charger. I just place the phone on the charger next to my bed now without a blinding light. The lights can even by completely covered by the phone to hide the dim green light even more. Well designed. Thanks TOZO.
","
My charging port quit working so I needed a wireless charger. This one did just the trick! So far so good!
","
This charger was great initially! But after a few months it randomly would stop charging. It doesn’t come with a block to plug into the wall so the charging power is up to you. A few times I left it to charge overnight and the battery hadn’t charged at all. But I left it plugged in the whole time and tested the outlet. Now the charger has completely stopped working and doesn’t even light up when plugged in any more. A shame!
","
Saw the same charger in a friends office and though the look was pretty sleek. Got mines today in a different color but it didn’t have the surface lights like the black version. Other than that so far so good!
","
I love it works like it should
","
Works well and looks good
","
This charger works very well as advertised.  Charges phone/ear buds quickly.  Thin and small takes up little room on the desk.  The light on the charger is not so obtrusive that it lights up the room at night.  Excellent charger for the price.
","
This wireless charger is classier than the typical wireless charger, it’s super easy to use. The only downside is the cord for it is a little short but that’s a personal preference thing.
","
I have a case that has a magnet in it and this charger works great with it.
","
I thought this was completely wireless for the outlet and for the phone. It was unclear in the description so I was not happy when I found out it still needa a wire. And then if it is not in the perfect spot it slips. One good idea would be to add something to keep the phone in place or make everywhere you put the phone able to charge! It charges slowlyas well or possibly I am in need of a new phone!
","
Worked great at first and I loved it. However over time it’s slowly stopped recognizing when items are placed on top. First it stopped recognizing my headphones’ charging case and now I’ll place my phone on it at night and it will start charging, but then it will stop charging at some point in the middle of the night. I keep waking up to a phone with a nearly dead battery.
","
Very Easy to Use and great on our nightstands!
","
It’s the perfect size for a desk! Charging is a little slow but that is to be expected with wireless charging. Overall great product!
","
I bought this charger because I was tired of all of my charging cords being on the table. I have a popsocket on my phone and have found it difficult to find a charger that will charge with the case and popsocket on it - this one works!  Very happy with purchase (even bought a couple more for my desk and nightstand!)
","
Seems weak. Left on pad all night still not fully charged. Seems to me to be a waste of money
","
This charger is well put together, and it helps that it looks amazing in person. It thin design makes it easier to put anywhere without any much space taken. The phone doesn’t need to be centered to charged, the color changes are very good, it’s green when there’s no device on it and it turns blue when there is a device on it. Definitely would recommend it.
","
Love the ease of use and quick charge! Works great with my tozo 6 wireless earbuds and my phone. The only downside is I have to remove the case to use on phone.
","
Product is as written on web page
","
Great wireless charger, iPhones are know for the charger ports giving problems. With this little device that’s no longer an issue. Fast changing small and convenient and it’s easy to use, would recommend for anyone who is looking for a wireless charger.
","
I love this product. My husband has an iPhone and I have Galaxy and both charge extremely fast. I purchase another to keep in my living room for when we have company so they can use to charge as well.
","
Seems very thin and light cheap material. Charges very slowly but it does work
","
I have this on my nightstand. It’s perfect for laying it on when I go to bed and when I get a call or text I don’t have to be tangled up in a cord. I could not rate it for traveling as I have only used it for home use thus far . Very happy with my purchase and it came fast.
","
I have used other wireless chargers without any problems.  This one requires precise placement to work which requires moving the phone on the pad, taking it on and off the pad, and rotating it on the pad to get it to couple.  There seem to be 3 LED light patterns. Green seems to mean that the unit is on and ready.  Blue is charging, and blinking is undefined (there are no instructions).  One night it quit charging at about 83% for no apparent reason, one night it took over a minute of moving the phone around to get it to couple.  When it does couple, the charge rate could be fast or slow, not sure what determines the charge rate (did I mention that there are no instructions).Not worth the effort, this one's going in the trash.
","
This charger works great for my iPhone 12pro max with a plastic case on it.  Magnet works well and I'm very pleased that they got rid of the lights from the earlier version (too bright).
","
Awesome product love it
","
The Product came as expected, nice for the price, work charm with Fast Wireless Chager. The only issue I have registering my product for Warranty, the Warranty link is down for sure
","
Love this product, doesn’t charge very fast but great for charging your phone at night. I got a crack in mine and customer service got back to me quickly about using my warranty to get a replacement.
","
Hmm, it works but I'm not sure how it is better than just plugging my phone in. Also, it doesn't come with the wall plug so I had to use the one from my phone charger anyway so... Not sure what's the point?
","
Still doesn't fix note 10 charging problem
","
Great wireless charger.
","
This charger looks great on my desk at work. Although it does not have a super quick charge like the Apple chargers, it is great to leave my phone on during the work day to charge. It has a very clean design and lights up blue when your phone is charging which is a nice feature to have. Overall, I am happy with this product.
","
The charger is slim and easy to use. It is a little particular about the phone being in a specific position in order to charge but loving this product.
","
Very surprised!I wasn't expecting such a nice wireless charger!  This has an oversized surface committed to my old charger.  It's at least half as thin, and has nice lighting.It seems to work just fine, and I'm probably going to buy another one for the bedroom.
","
I use this for my Galaxy S9 and My iPhone 12. I do not have to carry two cables.
","
Purchased with the Tozo T10 earbuds.  Works as advertised.  Very pleased with this charger.
","
I absolutely adore this product! However, it came with small bubbles and scratches, ruining its whole look. :/
","
I purchased 2 of these, one gold/white, one black. I love them. They work with our cases on and have been working well since purchasing about 3 months ago. The white and gold one is really very pretty. They are super slim and the lights are subtle, not disruptive in a dark room but it's easy enough to glance over and see that it's charging.
","
This is working great with my Samsung Note 9 and Galaxy 9. I've paired it with an Ankur multi-charger that supports QC 3.0 fast charge and it works great! very nice slim design with glowing leds. Prob too bright for next to bed but works great in our kitchen. I also have a pair of Tozo T6 earbuds and it charges them great too!
","
I bought this wireless charger to charge my Pixel and come to find out it also works with my air buds I purchased from this manufacturer. I look forward to purchase more from this company.
","
Great little charger. Honestly surprised at how good it's been. It's literally plug and play without being overly finicky like other wireless chargers. Best thing is it charges fast. Even my husband was surprised its charging speed. Speed for our Samsung phones was about the same as wired. Its also super thin making it great for traveling.
","
Convenient when travel
","
Its a good charge pad. Its a little heavier than i was expecting which just adds the the quality feel. It is usb-c, im not sure if it says that anywhere as i didn't really read the description. Also the included cable is decent and fits snug. Only time will tell whether or not this is actually a good purchase.

 Very light weight and perfect for my bedside table. I ordered this in white and gold, it matches all of the gold accents in my master bedroom perfectly! I’m ordering another one for my secret Santa gift exchange at work.
","
I really enjoyed this item. It is slim and pleasing to the eye. It came as shown online and had a great variety of colors. My only suggestion is that it come with a longer cord and the charging block.
","
Very easy to use. Love being able to just lay my phone down charge.
","
Just perfect I just got it today originally ordered it for my AirPods but I use it for all my phones and devices. It doesn’t take up space and you don’t have to worry about anything sliding off plus I really love the design definitely would buy again
","
The fit and finish looks amazing and it feels super premium. The USB C cable is nice over the micro USB. And best of all it charges almost just as fast as using a cable! The LEDs look very nice and aren't too bright for when you're asleep. Overall these are amazing, especially for the price!
","
This is a great wireless charger! I bought 2 of them to try it out. One for me and the other for my wife. We both love the ease of just laying the phone on the charger, instead of having to plug it in every time. She has asked me to get another one she can take to work. It charges fast! Even with thick phone cases.
","
I must have gotten a defective device at first that did not work- the customer service team reached out to me immediately to replace it- the new device works great as expected-no issues here.
","
Its very high quality for its price, its very powerful as its able to charge my phone from 0-20 in around 8 minutes, its a great grip and weight to it so no chance of any loose or wobbling.
","
The charger is very slim, it can fit in any small pocket of a backpack without creating any bump. It is really easy, you put it on the table and plug it to either a USB port or to the wall. Charging my earbuds case was really really fast.
","
This product is definitely worth the price! I love that I don’t have to look for my charger in the dark anymore, I can just slap my phone right on the charging pad and it’s so easy to use. 10/10 recommend!!
","
Work perfectly
","
Was really awesome and worked great but randomly stopped working. The tip of the cord would get really hot and the device wouldn’t turn on anymore. Pretty bummed about it because it was really convenient and good price. Not sure if I spilled something on it or what. I got a good few months out of it before it stopped working though
","
iPhone 12 ProMax with otterbox+pop case WORKS!! I have been trying to find a wireless charger that will work with pop socket ON and not have to twist it off, and this does it!! I am happy with the purchase for that reason alone!
","
It's very compact and very sleek looking. Def a game changer. Simply plug it in peel off the sticker on charging pad and literally charge your phone. We got two of them thankfully i read all the reviews. Must have!!
","
I have an iPhone X and purchased this charger to use at my desk while at work. It looks sleek and is aesthetically pleasing and professional. It technically works but the charging is VERY slow. If I play downloaded music on my iPhone while working- the music playing drains the battery faster than it charges.For example: if I put the music on and sit it on the charger with 80% battery left then return in 2 hours... my battery is 78%.Now, had I not had the charger it would’ve been less than that, but still - not great.Also - when I have no other apps running and it’s simply charging I will gain a percentage or two every half hour.
","
This wireless charger works very well, the only issue I have is that the surface of the charger is super smooth so you have to make sure the phone doesn't get bumped off.
","
This charger works great with the ear pods by Tozo. Just put the ear pods on this charger and wait for the light to let you know when it is ready.
","
This charger works VERY well and with  dirent phones includint iPhone. It is small and works well. Even charges in t he car.nI bought THREE so you now they worl well. Price is right as well. Love this !!
","
Whether it's convenience or speed you're looking for, this little baby has them both!Easy to set up and use. It literally can't be easier to charge your phone. Just set it up next to your favorite sitting chair and everytime you sit down and lay your phone down, BOOM! you're charging away!
","
I have an iPhone XR and it charges my phone fast.  You just lay the back of your phone on the charger and it charges your phone.  I highly recommend.
","
Great
","
We did a complete remodel and I decided I needed a charging pad to complete the look of my new work area. It’s the perfect size, sleek and effective :)TOZO warranty was easy to process and will definitely be ordering more of these for the whole house!
","
Seems to work fine
","
Never used a wireless charger before. I was always skeptical of them. I use this charger for my iPhone 11 and my bluetooth headphones and it works like a charm! I highly recommend this product!
","
Excellent alternative to the lightning cord. While working you just place your iPhone or iPod on the disc, and it turns blue while charging and green when done. Light weight and easy to pack for travels. Highly recommend this product.
","
Very cute and sleek charger! Really liked it at first but it does take forever to charge! Only had it a couple months and it completely stopped working so that was a little disappointing.
","
This is an beautiful wireless charger! It’s a clean, modern and slim design. Not picky about placement (doesn’t have to be completely centered). It has indicator lights on the top that are green when not in use and blue when charging. They are very subtle and do not light up the room at night. Great value! Highly recommend! Should have bought this a long time ago!
","
this wireless charger from TOZO is a great product. I have been searching for weeks for a wireless chargers I am so happy with the charger. it's very little to carry when you travel. it charges super fast. TOZO has a new costumer for life.
","
It is hardly thicker than the USB C port it has, and it's made out of Apple quality materials, so it looks super modern. It's glass on the top with faint LEDs that aren't too distracting. If it had an Apple logo on it I wouldn't be able to tell if it was a real Apple product, that's how nice it is.
","
Nice wireless charger, even cooler I can charge my TOZO headphones with this. Model does not work with my current phone, but thats probably because my cell phone is a big on the cheaper side. Still an EXCELLENT product!
","
I was not sure if I would like this charger but I love it. Very convenient to have next to a laptop/ computer. It’s a must buy if you’re working from home during this pandemic and/or office.
","
Good, fast charger. I like the light that indicates it’s charging and the nonslip bottom. I use mine at the office and am easily able to transport it with me anywhere.
","
I’ve been wanting a wireless charger for some time because all the plug in chargers always go out within a few months. I’m excited to try this one. It’s sleek, and charges pretty fast so far!
","
Ease of use
","
Super easy to use with my wireless headphones or my phone. Just set it down no more fussing with any cords in the dark. The design is sleek and looks high end! I definitely recommend!
","
Everything was perfect, looks very good:-)!
","
Good product
","
So far i love it! I purchased a couple of the top selling competitor models and they where very cheap plastic and only worked a few months. This one is solid an sleek.
","
I like this so much I ordered two! I have a white one for my desk at home and a black one for my desk at school and they are low profile, sleek, and work exceptionally better than any others I have owned.
","
Be perfect if the cord was longer.
","
WOW, what a pleasant experience! The wireless charger arrived right on schedule, was very well packaged, and looked and felt just as described! The wireless charger has a heavy and sturdy feel. Comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable so it works with my Note 10+ Super Fast charger! LOVE IT - WELL WORTH the price I paid!
","
This is a great item. Works as designed. I love the magnetic connection so you know it’s connected and the color of the led light. Product worth the buy! My friend saw it and is jealous and has ordered theirs too.
","
So easy to use! It charges a little slower than a cord but its so much nicer than plugging in all the time. I like the lights showing its charging and I can see when it's done and find it in the dark. Charges easily through my case
","
This charger is just great, it is compatible with all of my devices and it works quickly. It is thin and light weight making it portable. I also love that it uses usb-c. It is just perfect for my needs and I recommend it to all.
","
My first wireless charger, and I think a great pick. I got the black, which looks great on my dark furniture. Very low profile, nice looking overall. And wireless charging! I love reaching over to pick up my phone in the morning to look at my calendar or email and not having it ""tethered"" to a plug. Should have done this a long time ago.
","
Have been using this Cather for about a week. I love it. It charges very fast. I have only used it for my phone so far with the cover on it. It works great
","
Great choice for a wireless charger for my Iphone 11 Pro. I'm impressed how compact, lightweight, and well designed this charger is....Also, hassle free setup and it starts charging right away. LED lights looks cool especially at night. Overall this is a great charger for the buck and recommend users who own a bulky phone case to purchase a thinner one for charging with case on.
","
The wireless charger arrived in high-quality packaging. Once I unboxed it, I plugged it into a USB wall block and it worked right away! I bought 2 and love how they look. They are very minimalist and modern looking, with a solid green light when there is no device charging and a solid blue light when I place my iPhone on it. Very futuristic looking.
","
It works great but when received no cord or Square. On box it does say cord with but didn’t come with box
","
Better than the ones I had previously. Super slim as well and the indicator is very helpful to ensure that the device is charging. Great product especially for the price.
","
Great compact little wireless charger. I have it mounted on a phone mount in my vehicle and it's fantastic!
","
I was expecting something bulky or something where it had a giant mounted cable but its surprisingly thin as well as easy to use, i would recommend this to anyone that has a newer iphone
","
They are durable and so convenient for traveling. Very easy to use, When you put your phone on it, the the light changes from green to blue and you’re charging.
","
I really like this charger! Make it easy at night with the green lights to just lay your phone down lights turn blue and you ready to go to sleep. I don't have to find a cord, turn on the lights to see where to plug in the cord, fight with cord cause it don't want to plug in right and calm down to go to sleep!
","
Did not work for my android
","
A friend of mine owned a TOZO charger and I was so impressed with the quality and price point, I had to get one of my own. Super easy to setup with a simple but attractive aesthetic. I’ve looked at a lot of wireless chargers, and while not the only good option out there, it’s one of the few I’d recommend for the price. Snag it!
","
Funciona excelente con mi Galaxy pero con un LG no funciona. Le doy 5 estrellas pq lo compre para mí uso personal y no tuve problemas. El LG es del trabajo.
","
Trabaja también para cargar cualquier tipo de celular.
","
This product is not satisfactory at all.  I bought it hoping to use when traveling.  It only charges my phone when it hooked up to USB cord and Adapter.  It is not wireless.  I will not send back because it is not worth the trouble.
","
Awesome wireless charging pad! Even works with my pop socket on my iPhone 12, and charged my Tozo T6 earbuds lightning fast. Of all charging pads I’ve used, this one is my favorite.
","
Strong range!  I have one of the other brands also.  This one is much stronger from a range standpoint. Powers through 1/8” wood and a case!
","
So far so good, plug it in (need a block) and thankful it has a regular usb plug
","
Easy set up, works well, i like the light that shows when charging, overall a good item. Hopefully it will last.
","
A wonderful choice for a wireless charger. The design is really great, it just suitable to put anywhere.The charging experience is great, too. The color is noticeable but not too shiny. It also has object detection, the light will blink when you put something, say key chain, on it and it will stop charging.Overall,  it' s a great product and highly recommend.
","
My charger broke within the month . The charge took forever.
","
Works well! but with the latest update to my Gaxaly Ultra 21s. it no longer will fast charger =(  I still love the responsiveness of this and hope an update will allow the fastcharger function to work again with this newer Samsung.
","
I love that this it’s compact and can be taken anywhere!  It charges my iPhone as well as my ear pods!  Glad I purchased this!  Highly recommend!
","
I absolutely adore this, used with a iPhone XR works with cases too, super sleek and easy to travel with, and amazing quality, and great price. It also lights up blue to tell you if you phone is actually charging! 10/10 recommend!
","
I couldn’t have got a more convenient charger.
","
I bought this charger in Oct and use it almost every night for either my phone or my TOZO headphones. It's super easy to use and I love the convenience of it!
","
Constantly shines an ugly blue/green light when charging. Entirely useless and very ugly. Considering returning because of this.Product works well enough, but I'm very disappointed that they ruined its clean look, which I now partially cover with electrical tape.
","
Great charger that really exceeded my expectations. As you can see in the photo attached, it even seems to charger fine with my case and pop socket attached to the back of my phone, which is very bulky. Very satisfied with purchase!
","
I needed to upgrade my wireless charger because it charged my phone way too slow and after some research I decided on the TOZO wireless charger. I love it! It's lightweight, sleek, and looks great on my desk. It charges my iPhone X about an hour faster than my last wireless charger. All you need is a 9V wall adapter. I would absolutely purchase another TOZO wireless charger.
","
Fast charger. Looks great. Only thing I dislike is that charging pad lights stay on all the time.
","
I really like this product.  The wireless charger is light, modern, and very easy to use.  I just plugged it into an adapter and my phone started charging instantly.  Sometimes, it doesn’t work if I position the wrong way, but that’s ok.  Thank you!
","
Love it! Works great and charges my ear buds great. And phone but I have to tske off my snapcircle on the back off to charge it but other than that it does everything!
","
This charger comes in clutch while working from home. All I have to do is sit my phone down and boom it’s charging. It works well with my phone case also which is a definite bonus. I’m very glad with my purchase.
","
I’m very impressed with the speed of charging and the battery holds its charger better.
","
Great device instead of plugging in and out a cable.  Sooooo easily charges your phones.
","
Works as advertised.  Would be better if charging cord was longer.  Would like to use phone while it is being charged but difficult due to short cord.
","
Arrived quickly. Easy to setup and would be great to take if going on a trip. Holds my iphone plus perfectly. Charges quickly and led lights on side indicate status. Love it and am ordering more for the rest of my family
","
Decent Charger I would say over all. The piece for the usb c to a was not working when I purchased it. The charger also not as strong with a case on the phone
","
Bought for lg g6 didn't work on it. But it worked on my daughters iphone
","
I’ve only just used it but it seems to work fine and goes well with my bedside table. Happy with my purchase.
","
I already was a fan of wireless charges but this thing is great! It charges quickly, it’s nice and light and thin which makes it perfect for travel. I will be keeping it with my phones wireless charger.
","
Nice wireless charger ,  It is connected to my computer table plug and I just place my phone on the charger now . Its so easy and my phone is always charged these days . I hope  this lasts forever .
","
Not only does the charger look great, but it works great as well! I’ve used it for both my AirPods Pro and my iPhone 11 Pro Max. Super sleek design and fast charging.
","
It was great, when it worked.  It worked well for the iphone 13 pro max.  I recently bought the Tozo NC9 earbuds, and put them on the charger.  Lights lit up like it was trying to work, then shut off.  In that quick instance, the charger does not work.  Not sure if it fried the system or what.  The Tozo NC9 earbuds no longer work either.  I assumed they were compatible, but I do not recommend using them together.  From my experience, it will fry both electronic devices.  Now I have 2 useless products.  Tozo products have been good to me, but I have experienced different recently.  May be time to switch it up
","
I just wish the cord was longer.
","
Looks nice, very thin and easy to slip into a carry bag, and it charges as advertised. However, the LEDs stay at full brightness whenever the unit has power applied, so it's not the best thing for a bedroom.
","
I have always wanted a wireless charging unit for home. At night I sometimes have to grab my phone and go based on my job and have yanked the cord half asleep. This is a great product. Really like it. Will order another.
","
Quality is very nice.  Solid construction.  I got the grey to place on the iMac stand.  It matches it perfectly.  The top where the phone goes is a soft rubber and the edge is a polished metal.  Comes with micro usb cord but no charger.  I just plug it into my computer.
","
this wireless charger is amazingly thin! I don't use it for my main charger, only for when I'm in my game room. And for the price this product is fantastic. Its glass on top and solid metal construction for the body. The led indicators do not seem cheap, and change color when your phone is charging.
","
Very sleek and stylish looking.  So far it does as it should...it charges iPhones, Bose earbuds, airpods, etc...The real test will be how long it lasts...hopefully for quite awhile.  Price was very reasonable as well.
","
This charger is so much better than the one I purchased from the Apple store when I bought my phone. It plugs into a USB port so no a bulky adapter.  It lights up blue while charging and green when finished so you don't need to check your phone for charge.
","
Charging is to slow
","
I left my phone on it to charge for 5 minutes or so, it charged 3%. I picked up my phone, which has a ring on it, and the ring burned my fingers. Both the pad itself and the back of my phone were crazy hot.
","
I love the way that right out of the box, you can just plug into an adapter, and then boom! charging! 100/10⭐️ no adapter cube but if you have one lying around, there you go!
","
Don't look any further guys, like all consumers, I have looked through all the other ones on amazon. This charges my phone is 2hrs and 15 min from dead with a 3amp plug in. Pretty close to my 3amp plug + 3amp type c wire. And look at this design. I was scared that the performance was traded for the asthetics but they really put money into both
","
Perfect!
","
Perfect for mobile office!!Replaced the included usb-c cord with a 6” one.
","
So far so good. Easy enough to use.
","
This charger is so easy to use, I was looking for a wireless charger that actually worked and was also cute and this is it! I can even use it with my phone case on which is a nice plus!
","
Nice charger! Love the “MagSafe” features and low profile. Works well with any new MagSafe device or any wireless charging device(charged my AirPods with it). Highly recommend, especially if you want the “MagSafe” features at a more affordable price.
","
I bought two of these. They look great and charge quickly. My only negative is that the lights are bright so you need to lay the phone over to cover them at night or they will light up your room.
","
So far I really like it, it was easy to set up & the charger seems to work quickly and even w/ my phone having a thick case & popsocket on it. I've only had it for a few hours so far.
","
Worked well for a couple months. Now it blinks and doesn't always work. Constantly need to be unplugged and leave powered down for a couple minutes to work again. Looks real nice and works well when it's in the mood 😂
","
I like this newer version of their wireless charger being it’s lower profile & less light (previous version had brighter LED’s which lite up the bedroom at night which I disliked)Charges quicker than standard wireless chargers. For the price I would recommend it to others.
","
A very easy to use and lovely charger will get others in more colors
","
Works great and is super slim. Beautiful low profile. I just wish I could turn off the lights on it. When you have blackout curtains in your room, the lights on the charger seem too bright
","
can't get it to work and instructions are to small to read.
","
This wireless charger is thin and compact. Easy to use. My iPhone will not charge on the case (it’s 2 layers); however, the intent was to charge my T6 earbuds and that works great. Eventually I may get a thinner iPhone case.
","
This is a very cool looking, low profile charger that blends right on my desk at work. In fact my coworker almost tried to put his drink on it thinking it was a coaster. Ordering another for home
","
Really quick and easy to use.
","
Product works great
","
I use this charger for the office at myjob and it’s so quick to charge and easy to transport. Small enough to fit in a pocket and a really fast charge. Solid product build too!
","
Bought it because my S8 Active charging port wasn't working.  This was the perfect fix. Also use it for my Kyocera Duraforce Pro 2. So far,  so good.  Works great and love how the lights change when your charging so you know if your device is on the pad correctly.
","
I do not know how Tozo does it, but this is a great wireless charger at super cheap price (I paid $10 with a deal).  it is bit smaller than I had expected it, but it works very well for my Samsung phone & few other earbuds.  Very happy customer.UPDATE: I have been using this for a while, a month or so.  unfortunately, it does not charge my Samsung S22 phone anymore.  It makes my phone very hot and does not charge.  Very disappointed.  However, it does charge my smaller devices, such as earbud cases.  However, I bought it mainly for my phone charge, so I am very disappointed at this device.
","
Works great
","
It charges fast which is nice. Looks amazing
","
Very sleek & charges quickly.
","
Great designIt is the perfect gift to wife or daughter.So easy to install, I have and iPhone X and earbuds witless and works perfect with them
","
Small and stylish. Biggest problem is that it doesn't work through a light weight case and pop socket. I have to take it off in order to use so depending on my activity level I may not use. I do know there are stronger output chargers that can charge through case. But it's very portable and pleasing to the eye. Works on a pixel 3. And fferent color cord would be cool as I got all black and came with white cord.
","
Worked fine out of the box, just what I was looking for at a reasonable price. Not as fast as a corded charger off course but less hassle.
","
Ya no mas estar con el celular descargado
","
a great wireless charger, no jerry-rigging to work like I've had to with past wireless chargers. very cheap and packaged nicely. a little too big to fit in a regular-sized pocket, but is more meant for stationary charging. great product!
","
I started using my wireless charger a few days ago and couldn't be more satisfied! It comes with a cable but not a plug sp make sure you have one of those. I hated having to turn on my light at night to find my cable to charge my phone but now I don't have to anymore. Makes life so much easier! Highly recommend.
","
Very Good charger, did not know what to expect and way easier to charge your phone in the middle of the night! works great with my iphone11 through the case!
","
It doesn't charge as fast on my android Samsung Galaxy 20FE
","
So perfect and simple! I plugged it in, placed my phone on top and it started charging! I have a thin pop socket on my phone and it worked. My mom has a wallet case and it worked with her as well!
","
This charges my iPhone 8 Plus well, even with a relatively thick rubber case on it.  Just lay the phone on the charger and that's it.
","
This charger is easy to use and travels well. I use it to charge my earbuds and they charge quickly. Very nice little gadget to have on hand and small enough to travel with me for an extra charging station.
","
The charger seems to have worked for a day or two. It now does not. It was a gift. I purchased the charger for someone, cheap as it was, still didn’t work the way it was intended. Rendering it actually useless. (And yes it was tried and tested with many different “compatible” phones with and without protective cases and screens etc.) If the design is and was for the charger to work only one day it needs to be specified clearly in the description. Which seems to be counterproductive. If not, one could make the claim that the items (maybe items but at least particularly this item) sold from the seller are not worth the purchase due to defect, mal-intent, or neglect. None of which are helpful to a buyer looking to spend money wisely. I cannot make the claim that all items from this manufacturer are ill built or defective, but the one I purchased seems to be and  does not produce the intended result. Hopefully this informs your decision about buying this particular charger.
","
The box comes with the TOZO wireless charger and the cable. There is not adapter (the cube thing). The design looks really good and high tech if you asked your friend how much will you pay for this charger they will say over $50. And the glass looks really good the Aluminum quality is good if apple made one it will look like this.
","
Good charger. Had it for a few months, still works just fine
","
Great product and has a really nice finish on it. Very well built. Only down fall is lights never shut off. So you see them all night when you are trying to sleep.
","
It is nice and sleek and doesn't interfere with decor. It charges fast and is easy to take with you... small enough to fit in your purse.
","




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Simple and sleek,  Product is as described. Charging time takes longer than expected but the value is definitely in the product.
","
I like the grips on the bottom because you can put it on basically any surface, even if the surface is uneven or slanted.Item is ultra thin which makes it great for travel.I would definitely buy again.
","
I ordered one to see how I felt about charging wirelessly. After using it, I feel AWESOME about charging wirelessly! I will be ordering a few more to replace my old charging spots around the house! These a thin and sleek and look much nicer than scraggly cords laying everywhere!
","
This is a great, easy to use, wireless iPhone charger. We've tried a few - this one is easy to set up and use, lightweight enough to travel with (when we are able to travel again).
","
It could be user error but when I plug it in, it just flashes green and doesn’t charge. Perhaps I bought the wrong adapter?  If so, then I’m not sure which adapter to buy. It’s for an iPhone 11. Our iPad adapter also does not work. No matter which one I try, it just flashes green and doesn’t charge. I wish it would just show the correct compatible adapter to buy when purchasing.
","
slow phone charging
","
Purchased this and wanted to register for the 1 year extended warranty but the link to register it does not work. Also the email of info@tozostore.com is an invalid email. What’s the point if I can’t register for my warranty and can’t even contact them.
","
It works great
","
Absolutely love them l! I ordered 4 to put next to everyone's bedside and they are so sleek and nice looking that it doesn't take away from the room decor. And works great too!
","
I was very impressed on how it charged as well as a samsung.  it is also very slim to fit anywhere you want to go!  buying another one for my wife.
","
I’ve just started using this wireless charger as soon as I received the product and so far it has been really impressive. I like the fact that it’s sleek and clean cut look in terms of design. The fast charging works well but only the cable provided is a little short, not a big issue. Overall, I am very pleased with the product and also the customer service from them!
","
It looks very modern and sharp but....I was out for a month and didnt use it more than 5 times at first. Now I wish I could still return the charger as I've been actually using it and learned that it's completely unreliable.You'll put your phone on it and it starts charging (and it charges very very slow). The following day your phone sometimes is dead or it just never fully charged.Blue charging light will switch back to green overnight as if your phone is no longer there anymore.Very upsetting and dissappointing as the device looks so good and I had high expectations for it.
","
This charging pad works with both my tozo earphones and with my samsung galaxy S10, albeit the charge speed is only normal speed which I assumed I could speed up with an adapter but it doesn't seem to be the case. Regardless this charging pad fulfills my needs and I'm satisfied.
","
This product is very easy to use, but does not charge at a fast speed
","
Ordered a new iPhone. Wanted to try a wireless charger. The white/rose gold caught my attention. The charger is shiny and pretty. Very aesthetic to any decor. Plugged it in and boom! Done! Easy peasy. Doesn’t come with the wall plug but that’s ok. Think I’ll buy another for another room. Plus comes with a one year warranty.
","
It works ok but it takes a long time to charge my Samsung S21 Ultra
","
The product is nice looking and a fair price! However, it charges everything very slowly! After charging my phone for 8hrs, it'll be at 74%.
","
We just started using these but so far they seem to work great! You just set your phone on it and the light turned blue to indicate that it’s charging. Very simple, and they look nice too.
","
Its a good wireless charging unit as long as it's on a good flat surface. Charging your phone on a slight angle will easily make your phone fall off. Hope this help.
","
Super cute. Charges fast.
","
No matter what I did, this charger did not work for my Android phone. Other wireless chargers do, so it's not me, it's not my phone, it's this thing which failed. Go elsewhere, try a different product, if you don't have an Apple or Samsung phone.
","
Bought to charge my iphone. Love the magnet connection. Will charge the phone but not if the phone is in use with charger connected. Phone battery depletes with charger connected when you're playing games, reading news.
","
First off, the packaging was really nice. I was surprised especially for the price. It looks exactly as pictured and hardly even looks like its there. Its amazing that it works so well with it being so thin. I really like how the surface lights change colors in order to tell you if your device is charging or not. Overall very happy with my purchase.
","
I love that this wireless charger is slick and compact in design and super inconspicuous. It sits on my desk all pretty and shiny and the first thing I do when I get home from work is stick my phone on it. No need to fumble with wires. Perfect!
","
Very thin, very easy to use, just put the phone on top. The quality looks and feels amazing. Recommended.
","
This is an excellent value and works amazing with all of our phones!  It's so nice to not have to plug a cord in especially at night when we are sleepy.
","
It doesn’t come with an AC adapter which requires the orange 3.1 USB port for the 10w charging but I have a few lying around and it works wonderfully with my iPhone 12 Pro with a case on. Fast shipping, great warranty.
","
We have purchased a number of these products over the years for a various devices and I’ve had nothing but excellent customer service. The product is reliable and the price is definitely right.
","
I hate cables with a passion and I use my iPhone X pretty much all day. First time trying a wireless charging and could not be happier with the idea that I no longer have to deal with charging cables with my phone or my headphone. I'm loving this thing!
","
simple, discreet and amazingi love the fact tht its tiny and can be put in any bag or backpack. Perfect to use when you forget your wire charger at home and you need to charge a device.
","
My savior.  My Lg G7 thinq stopped charging with a plug...i had to put 1 of these in every room of the house and one at work!
","
This just feels like solid quality. It works well. There is a reason it's Amazon's number one choice for a wireless charger. Very convenient and much easier than plugging and unplugging or having different type of cables laying everywhere.
","
Looks good and charges fast! Good buy...
","
Love the unit.  Makes charging so easy.  Liked it so much that ordered 2 more for my son and wife too.
","
Easy setup and ready to go. Love it.
","
Will be grabbing this exact brand when/if I need more. Works well, looks nice for the price this is pretty much a no brainer, grab one.
","
Fast charging in a convenient package, this charger hits all the check boxes.
","
This charger is awesome and it works amazing ! I was quite skeptical about it but it exceeded all my expectations . I like the way it changes color when my phone is done charging that's helpful . I highly recommend this charger !
","
This very slim and sleek wireless charger does its job well! I was worried with my thick Otterbox case that my phone wouldn't charge, but that didn't seem to be the case! My phone charged at the same speed as plugging it into my wall charger so I'm very pleased with this product!!
","
Worked as expected.  Good value for the money
","
This product exceeded all expectations surrounding upgrading from other previous bulky electronic wireless charging devices. The slim, sleek and ergonomic design is not only visually appealing, but it goes with everything else in my room style-wise. The customer service with TOZO was incredible and I will be referring friends and family to them for all wireless charging needs. The one-year warranty was also an added bonus!
","
Works
","
I use this charging pad for charging our iPhones and my Tozo earbuds. The pad looks great with its slim profile, dim lights, and it charges fast! Would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality charging pad.
","
This makes owning an iPhone so much cooler.It’s still working after one month & seems to be OK.But they promised me a free charger if I gave them a positive review & I still haven’t seen that promise fulfilled.
","
Who wants to spend time recharging their cell phone when the main issue is getting the “info” the rest of team!” This is infallible....and a huge time-saver! Value beyond it’s cost!
","
Stop charging my iPhone after sometime
","
So it's a pretty device.  A charging cable is twice as easy to use.  Plug it in and you are done.  This device REQUIRES precise placement on the surface, otherwise...the iPhone screen turns on and off, and on and off and doesn't charge.In two nights of use I found this device an incredible pain.  I have an iPhone 8plus.The most important thing to know about this device?  If you do not orient the device properly, the iPhone slowly, inexoribly, moves across the very slick surface of the pad.  (Of course, the 8plus is glass so it's slick too.)  The second night, in spite of the fact that I thought I had properly placed it, I was awakened 15-30 minutes later by the sound of my iPhone FALLING OFF OF MY NIGHT STAND ONTO THE FLOOR.  So exact placement is necessary to get it to charge and avoid breaking your phone!  My phone did not break, but clearly, this is a big risk.Forget wireless charging...I'm happy to plug in every night.PS - the lights are way to bright for my preference - lights up a dark room if the phone was not on the charger.
","
Seems to work as designed and it looks sleek.
","
Charging station seems to work fine but the Tozo earbuds that I got the same day died in a couple days. I can use it to charge my iPhone now I guess.
","
Love that charges my iPhone fast & I can leave the case on.
","
Very easy to setup with a regular USB end and then USB type c on the other end that goes into the charger. I got black which is nice cause it matches my desk. Recommended by af fiends and definitely does the job and love using it for my AirPods too.Highly recommend having at least one of these in the house.
","
Change fast you can take it any place
","
For charging phones and other products it's good but for the tozo T6 for me is doesn't work unless you put a phone or other product that does and switch it out for the earbuds
","
Bought 2  for use in the house.3rd as gift.Very elegant. Super thin
","
I am so pleased I bought this! Not only does it work great for charging but it also has a sleek and compact design which I love. I can’t believe I waited this long to get one. Definitely recommend
","
Nice smooth exterior. Thin and solid. I'm much prefer this to the bumpy plastic things that I've bought previously. The lights give it a nice little spacey feel to it also.
","
I love this! It never slips off of my desk and it charges relatively fast. I should have got one of these a while back, but was hesitant on how good of a wireless charger I could get, and I am definitely satisfied with this wireless charger.
","
Very easy to use
","
It works with Samsung phones or tozo earphones to keep you charged. Its easier to use the having to connect your devices using USB.
","
The charger is compact and has a nice build to it. The matte black charger provides a good trip for my OnePlus 9 as well. Super easy set-up, very happy with the purchase.
","
Super easy setup, and I love that it also charged my Apple AirPods! It's also really lightweight and has a clean, sleek look to go nicely just about anywhere you place it. But, it stopped working after about 2 weeks for me. Will be returning this one.
","
I was surprised by how small and thin(less than a half inch)but it works great! Like most other wireless chargers, it will not charge your phone if it has a heavier cover but still great product for the price.
","
Really easy to use! Super sleek and pretty as well. It needs to be plugged in when charging your device so it’s not the same as a portable charger. Some cases won’t charge through it so make sure your case is wireless charging enabled.
","
I just plug this into my laptop and charge my iPods and everything else that accepts wireless charging on it! So convenient and works great.. can’t beat it for the price
","
It works well enough, but having to find an adapter for it was a bit of a pain. Does not charge nearly as fast as a regular old charging cable, and the magnet seems to stick to everything but the phone!
","
Charges my new iPhone XS quickly with a USB cord connected to a 4.8amp power outlet.  Hardly gets warm at all.  I really like that the green lights light blue when the phone is positioned well and charging.  You can turn the phone sideways and completely cover the LEDs so it won’t bother you while sleeping.I want another one but the silver and white is discontinued... bring it back!!
","
The person I gave it to really liked it
","
I love this charger! I keep it on my desk so I can just put my phone down and not even think about it!The charge pad doesn’t come with a wall adapter, and the charge cable is sub par. That said, all you need to do to make this an amazing pad is buy a wall adapter and a new cable. The pad itself is perfect!
","
Very weak charge to begin with. Then, after a  pulled of uses the charger stopped working. Very disappointed.
","
I would recommended this product for my friends and family. The only thing I am concern is when I charging my earbuds sometime wouldn’t change the light back to green so that I don’t really know is done charge it or not. Maybe just because my earbuds need to be charge at all times. Overall the product is working great for now.
","
This thing does the trick, I charge my phone while at the office and it works just fine. It charges through an otter box case and I don’t have to worry about phone placement on the pad. Would get another for my home office.Not sure if I would travel with it, don’t think that’s its intended purpose. Five stars anyway.
","
I’m not happy with this product the charging powder is not good at all and take forever do not recommend wanted to because looks nice but no
","
No me deja cargar mi celular y noviene instructivo de que significan las luces, cuando pongo mi teléfono parpadea la luz verde, cualquiera que sea la dirección en qué pongo el teléfono, lo único que carga son los audífonos
","
This was one of two brands purchased.  This worked great to sit on the kitchen counter and charge my wife's phone and ear buds.  Very convenient, clean, and worked like a charm.I even used this at times for my phone.  Suddenly noticed that it was not charging as fast and then immediately noticed the charger would charge for a second and then stop.  Then charge, stop, charge, stop and so on.This will not hold a steady charge and is annoying.I went on their website and there is no one to talk to.  I am in the chat now and the auto reply has stopped.This was good for the time it worked.  Now this is really of no good to us.If you want a charger that will last for about 4 months this is the one for you
","
Really good charging power and easy to use! I always forget to charge my phone and thus end up over sleeping. With this, I just have to set my phone down
","
This charging works great for the tozo Bluetooth headphone, I’m impressed.Only annoyance is it won’t charge my phone with my case on but I didn’t get it for that, so it’s fine.
","
Works well. Easy to use. Saves wear & tear on the charging socket.
","
This thing is so cute for my desk, and it’s very easy to use. The only problem is that it doesn’t charge fast at all. Very slow charging with AirPods and my iPhone. Still will keep it because it’s convenient!
","
Very light and slim
","
I love it! Very easy & convenient to use. I have the white one. It turns green when it’s ready to use & turns blue when it’s charging your phone. I love the aesthetic!
","
Easy to use. Works right out the box and a way less hassle than plugging your phone up. At night I just throw the phone on there and drift off to dream land. Highly recommend
","
Easy to use, but charges a little slow but that is not a big deal for me. Seems to be very well designed/built and has a good sleek look. The cord could be longer and probably should come with a a/c adapter, but not having the a/c adapter is also not an issue for me. Time will tell on durability.
","
This does exactly what I ordered it for. I was sick of having multiple Apple charging cords plugged in around the house and this lets me reduce the cord collection by one room. I just received the charger so I will update as needed.
","
I bought 2. 1 in the bedroom the other in the kitchen. They work great and fast. There are lights on top that give status. In the bedroom I cover the lights with the phone at night.
","
One of the thinnest chargers out there. It's very slim and doesn't take up a lot of space. It has enough weight to stay put. It supports Fast Charge if your adapter puts out enough power.The input is a C type connector which is much more durable than the older style mini USB.  Included is the USB to C cable.
","
I really like the sleek look of this charger.  I was excited to use it.  Unfortunately it does not work as expected for my phone.  My husband and I have the iPhone XS, I am not sure if that makes any difference.  I have a pop socket on the back of my case so I took my phone out of the case to charge it.  The lights on the charger did change color to blue indicating that is was charging my phone, and my phone also showed that it was charging.  After a couple of hours on the charger though, the charge only went up from 16% to 37%.  My husband had his phone on the charger overnight and it didn’t charge his phone at all.  I’m not sure what the issue is, but it is first slow in charging as well as inconsistent.
","
Very sleek and sophisticated charger. Though it charges well, my phone became incredibly hot after only minutes of use. I even took the case off, which made no difference. I don’t think heat damages an iPhone, but it made it difficult to use my device after even a brief charging session.
","
I got this wireless charger for my wife for her birthday. She loves that the charger is small enough to put in her purse. The magnetic function is a bonus that allows her to continue using her iPhone while it charges.
","
I like the color changes that make it readily apparent when the phone is fully charged.
","
Great charger for the price, my S20 came with a charger but not a wireless charger, so this product fits perfectly for me. Very slim and light, good quality, and great price. Would definitely recommend
","
Bought 3 of them for work, home, and the girlfriend. Super easy setup, and worked immediately. I like how the colors change to tell you when it's charging, and when the battery is full.
","
Have tried a ton of chargers and nothing could get through my 8mm thick Quad Lock case.  This works perfectly!  Bought just for air pods but bonus ... now i have a working wireless charger for my iphone!
","
So far, it’s good. I’ll see how it holds up over the next few months.
","
simply put your phone facing up on the wireless charger and it will start charging. sometimes, if you dont places it properly, the light will blink green and you just have to reposition it correctly until the light turns blue.
","
Works with phone case and popsocket. Not really fast charging but works perfect for overnight charging
","
I bought this charger to charge my Tozo earbuds (which are great!), and it works like I expected it would. It seems to charge only until the charge is full then rests. It also works on my iPhones. The charger is very thin and has a cord that's long enough for me to leave it on a table. So far, I would definitely recommend this charger.
","
I use this one at work. I bought it because I have chargeable earbuds that I use daily and my previous charger wouldn't charge them. This one works like a charm and looks beautiful doing it.
","
You cant beat it.  It works great and just looks sharp.
","
The product works great, now my lazy ass doesn't have to plug the phone in next to me and I can just place it on this thin pad.  I mainly bought it to take with me on travel.  It works GREAT!!
","
Slow charge. 4+hours for my Samsung 10 when others will charge in 2 hours.  I'll always order upright ones now.  But it does charge and looks cool
","
Works as said as long as you have it plug in to the right wall jack.
","
Bought a few colors to see which would look nice on our house, and they were all much more attractive than I was expecting. Most have a smooth top but the grey is a rubberized grippy surface that’s also nice. Note that I’m new to wireless charging so not a review of performance, but they look good!
","
The product is really nice, sleek, and super easy to set up by using usb. However, my phone doesn’t charge all that fast. Thats my only problem, but I’m probably still gonna use it as a charging dock for when I sleep. You’re better off looking for a faster charging dock if it’s for on the go type.
","
Looks nice! I like the glass finish and silver ring around it. Some chargers can be finicky about how you set your phone down, this one isn't like that. I like it so much, I may order another one!
","
I'm very happy with it. Works great.
","
very easy to use and charges my phone very well
","
Very convenient and works great!!
","
The quality is very good. And very easy to use. I love this charger. No more plugging in for me. I wish I had found this earlier. I recommend this charger for anyone looking for a wireless charger for their phones! Totally worth it!
","
This is probably the best charger currently out right now, its fast, its small, its convenient and its super cheap. Once again a great product from TOZO. I definitely recommend it
","
I have been using different wireless chargers but they always overheat and break. This charger is fast, charges my phone completely and it doesn't melt my usb cord. So far great product.
","
Charges great and looks even better. Will update this review if anything changes!
","
It so easy for traveling, I love the size. It's so small and thin! It also hass excellent charging power! This was exactly the product I was looking for and I'm ecstatic that I found and bought it!
","
A good wireless charger for the price! I have woken up a few times after leaving my phone on the wireless pad, and it wasn’t charged at all- this may be user error but I have a slight suspicion the charger might glitch occasionally. It charges my phone and my non-apple wireless headphones in their case. Happy with this purchase, would recommend!
","
Easy to use by the bedside as well as in other locations without struggling.
","
Works perfectly; quick to charge
","
I bought this charger to replace the wireless charger that originally came with my iPhone. This one is much slimmer and looks much better overall. It also doesn't have some of the electrical whine noise issues I've had with past wireless chargers. I think this is definitely worth the money and a good replacement for the expensive Apple brand/Apple recommended wireless chargers.
","
Works on Google Pixel 4 XL even through my case.
","
Very sleek design. Was looking for a slim charger to build a customer wireless docking station in my truck. Most wireless chargers are atleast twice as thick and I was trying to avoid that.  I was a bit skeptical by the price but so far it works well. My phone links to it fairly quickly and it has no trouble charging my Note 9.
","
I really like this charger. It makes a pleasant “ding” when your phone correctly is placed on the charging disk. It also changes from green to blue and I haven’t noticed the light disturbing my sleep at all (which was listed in some reviews). Sleek design and easy to use right out of the box.
","
I’m a pharmacy technician and there are no outlets at my desk. I’m not allowed to plug my phone u to the computer for security violations, so this wireless charger is perfect for me. It small, cute, and works well.
","
This wireless charger is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something that was compact and light and would charge my phone and toothbrush, and that's what I got. I love it when something works as expected.
","
Really nice quality but it does charge slow if your phone is under 7% but other than that it works and gets the job done !
","
This charger is easy to use and very convenient!
","
This little wireless charger is amazing, it’s really small and very thin. It lights up green when it’s plugged in and charged my iPhone 12 with a case effectively. Love this cute little charger.
","
For any IPhone 12 users, this a very compact and efficient charger. The iPhone 12 now has that magnetic feature around the logo which you can attach accessories so this charger stays on much better than wireless charging platforms.
","
Small sleek and arrived quickly
","
A very straightforward product. You plug it up and place your device that is compatible with wireless charging and the light turns blue to indicate it is charging! Its lightweight so if you want to travel with it, its perfect!
","
I just received this charger, but so far it’s awesome! It makes charging my earbuds so easy and it looks nice. It’s low profile with a high end feel. It’s worth the purchase so far.
","
So far so good! Have been using it daily for a couple months and still works great! From reading other reviews I’m guessing it’s hit or miss with these but I love mine and for the price I can’t complain even if it ends up only working for a while it sure beats spending the extra money at apple for the same kind of product.
","
Charges fast.  Phone doesn't have to be placed exactly in the center of the charger.  It starts charging right away even if off centered.
","
Works great, extremely lightweight. Wish it charged a little faster, but I’m comparing it to my quick charge bulky charger and not the normal apple charger, which it’s pretty in line with. Happy with my purchase overall!
","
It does not work on my Samsung galaxy a50 but works for the Samsung galaxy S
","
The product was easy to set up and nice to use
","
I just got this package in the mail and I am very impressed with it. Being very technology driven I always like finding new gadgets to use. I really like the slim design of this charging pad and it's metal heavy duty feel. I also very much enjoy the lights that indicate when something is being charged, or is charged.
","
Charger is small and perfect for a nightstand or desk for charging spot. I have 2 around the house. Can easily charge my phone anytime and anywhere at home. Love it!
","
Slim design allowed it to be used on my existing stand.  The color of the unit goes from green to blue confirming that the charger has connected to the phone.Only negative is that the lights on the unit are pretty bright in a darkened room.  If you are going to keep this charger on a night stand you might want to block some of the light.
","
This is my first wireless charging pad and I love the sleek designs.  Super easy to use and it works perfectly with my newly bought AirPods 2.  Also, perfect for my iPhone X, I wish I would have bought it earlier!  No more wire cable!!  Would definitely recommend to my friends & family!!  Free One day shipping.
","
The product is simple to use, effective and easily portable. What more can you ask for with a new charger? Looking to use it with my new T12 headphones as well. Great product.
","
Funcional, la carga es algo lenta
","
It's was great love not having to plug in!So good I ended up buying  another!Actually this is my third one I've bought, one for home, one for work, and one for the car! It's fantastic!
","
Super sleek, very appealing appearance.
","
This product is thinner than one my husband bought for four times the price, and this one shows the charging status, my husband's does not.  I also appreciate the company offers a warranty for one year, which I hope I won't need!
","
I gotta say I'm a bit late to wireless charging but ilm so happy I came around. This charger is so easy to use and compatible with my Note 9 phone.
","
I like how it can determine if what is on it is a chargeable device and lets you know by the color flashes. It is an ""intelligent"" device. Charges my iPhone great.
","
I have to say that I am completely satisfied w this product.  It is easy to setup/use.  It lights up blue to ensure that your phone is properly charging.  It doesn't have to be completely centered but just close enough, which make it easy.  And the low profile makes it especially sleek to own and use.  No complaints.
","
I love the gold detail on the charger! It easily started working right away. The only thing I wish is that it would’ve came with a wall adapter instead of only the usb cable. But overall I really like the product, it looks great on my desk!
","
Sometimes it quits working and I have to unplug it and let it stay unplugged for it to work again. But other than that works well especially for the price. Overall I’m happy with it.
","
Excellent connectivity with solid sounds. I wouldn’t put them on par with high end earbuds, but compared to the sound of other wireless earbuds, including apples, these are top end. I’d buy them again for sure
","
The same day this wireless charger came in the mail, my husband had gotten his wireless charger collection out of his storage. He had one that was more like a dock, so we traded. It's extremely thin (pen for reference) but seems quality enough to last. It's very shiny.
","
Got 2 of these to leave in the kitchen & office desk so easy to put phone on & off as needed.  Works great .. looks great ... easy to use.
","
This super sleek modern design is amazing. I love the way this looks on my night stand super easy to use and charges the phone right away and doesn’t lag. Great product.
","
Not very good. I’ll think it’s charging my phone all night because it shows that it is. I wake up the next morning and my phones almost dead.
","
Sleek and nice design but it stopped working shortly after the return period closed. Wouldn’t recommend.
","
TOZO has great customer service .. very helpful ...
","
I’m sooo tired of replacing and spending $ for wired chargers every 3 months. This is the best thing ever! First of all, it’s beautiful and it matches my nightstand. Secondly, it’s so easy not to bother to plug anything and just put the phone on top of it and hear the “beep” sound and just go to sleep. Great product,  recommended!
","
Its a nice way to charge my phone. Not the quickest but its great. I bought two of them and they are placed on both nightstands for myself and my husband and its perfect.
","
A good part of this charger is, it is very sleek and has very fast charging, very much like the original ones which come with the phone. Because of its sleek design, I can easily carry it with my laptop in my laptop sleeve. Charging light glow is mild so it doesn't bother your eyes when it is kept in a dark room.
","
Purchased this about 35 days ago, and it stopped working today. Contacted Customer support, and they are sending a new one out to me. 👍🏻Clearly mine was defective.
","
No longer dealing with plugging and unplugging wires into my phone. Happy with the quality, color, texture of the product.Update: For the phone to charge, it needs to be placed properly over the charger. In my experience, if nearly 30% width of the phone is outside the boundary of device phone doesn't pick the charge. Haven't tried any other wireless charger so can't really say if its a technology issue or device limitation.
","
This wireless charger is absolutely beautiful! The design is sleek & thin & the lights on the side light up to indicate whether your phone is charging (blue) or not (green). It comes with a cable, but not the plug, which seems like an environmentally friendly solution as I’m sure most of us have plenty of those little plugs laying around. All around I’d highly recommend this product.
","
I just got to try this product today, but it is working well and it is so sleek and elegant! Never thought a charger could be so pretty and still be functional!
","
Cooool
","
I ordered the pink charger. It's very pretty. Obviously easy to use and it looks elegant on my nightstand. Very inexpensive and great quality. It also has grips on the bottom so it's not sliding around.
","
Easy to use but doesn’t charge all the time.
","
It’s great and easy to use. I have a metal plate on the back of my phone to use for my car mount, so you do need to take that off first if you have one.
","
Seems like it is made of higher quality, hope it performs just as well. I'll be 3D printing a stand for this and using it at my work desk. Will update my review if anything comes up
","
This is slim, easy to use and can be used for many different components.  I use it for my Samsung phone and my ear buds.  For the price, I am very happy.
","
Only had 1 day so far but thoroughly enjoy this! Very sleek & love the space gray color on the nice glass looking top. Charges all my products well & would stop charging my SE because it has magnets inside the case. So smart product that won’t overheat a phone.Great safety feature.
","
This is a very aesthetic wireless charger for home. I wouldn’t carry this extra bulky disk just so I can lay my phone on top to charge. If you connect this to a high amperage connector, it charges very fast. Also, it saves you from buying yet another lightening cable for your iPhone (if your iPhone has the capacity for wireless charging).
","
I have tried several wireless chargers and finally found a cost effective one that actually works.  I liked it so much, I bought a 2nd one for my office.
","
Item works. It does use a type c connection which helped ot charge fast so I had to find a charger box that used type c. Once I did it worked with phone and wireless ear pieces that used wireless charging
","
A must have charger.
","
Does what it is supposed too. Seems to charge faster than the last one I had of a different brand.
","
Got this as a gift for a friend and no complaints. Saw it in action the other day and it still works and is going strong
","
Well worth the cost
","
I had originally given this product five stars because when i first got it it worked fantastic and i thought it looked good. i’ve now had it for about three months and it no longer works. if i try to charge my airpods, they’ll charge for about two minutes then the charger will begin blinking green and will stop charging them. it was doing the same thing with my phone, it would charge for maybe five minutes then start blinking like something was wrong, but now it won’t charge my phone at all anymore. I haven’t moved it from my night stand and it’s gotten no damage done to it so i’m not sure what caused it to stop working after only three months.
","
I love it!  Best thing ever!  I will be getting one for every room!  So easy to use and don’t have all these cords laying around.
","
I use this to charge my iPhone 10 overnight. Completes the charge, but I don’t use it if I’m looking for a quick power recharge. Overall I’m happy with it and makes charging easy.
","
I use it in my home office for ensuring I always have a charger solely dedicated for my work phone.  It works and beats having to dig up a usb cord.
","
This is a very sleek and elegant looking charger. When plugged in it has a light that turns on  and stays on even if there’s no phone charging, so works like a dim night light too. Phone charges quickly.
","
Works great!  I have an otter box defender on my iPhone 8 and it charges with no problem. I just lay it on the center of the disc and it immediately starts charging. The directions didn’t include what the colors meant which would have been nice. Green means it’s on and turns blue while charging
","
I love that this will charge my wireless headphones as well as my Samsung phone! It is nice to be able to eliminate the need for a second charger. Great price too. You won't be disappointed!
","
Nice product. No wall adapter included.
","
Got this as a great combo deal with a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds. Works great to keep them charged without the hassle of plugging them in all the time. Very thin. Takes up little room and stylish.
","
I have bought five of these discs now and all work great.  Recommended.
","
Charger is so slim and fits so nicely anywhere! The white is bright and the sides light up when plugged in. It’s easy to transport between home office and bedroom!
","
My cat loves to chew on phone cords that lay on the floor when my phone isn't charging. This wireless charger is now set on my nightstand with the cord safely hidden behind so my cat can't get to it—all while looking great and working well so far!
","
Very easy to use and very thin. I have it even in my car when I’m on the go. Love the color and that it lights up different color when fully charged. Perfect for a gift to.
","
Already had one.
","
I got this for my bedside table.  It not only looks great, it is so easy to use.  It’s nice not having to look for the plug and plug and unplug the phone.
","
I have never used a wireless charger before but a friend told me about this one. I love it. Not only does it look good it works great too! Nothing to it I just plugged it in and away we go. I love the fact that it can sit out and people can use it without worrying about finding a wire that works
","
Super sleek and easy to use
","
Good product works great with my iPhones and AirPods and it’s very easy to use. Im in love with it! So worth they buy. Best product I’ve bought so far to charge my gadgets.
","
For technology enthusiasts
","
Did not work with my Samsung s21 ultra so I can't take much about the charging power or anything for that matter as I only got slow charging and I hope it didn't mess up the battery. Just be careful that it is compatible with your phone. It worked on my sons phone so instead of dealing with a return I ordered a different one for myself and gave this one to my son. He has to deal with the pink, lol.
","
Even if the phone lays Undisturbed on the surface, it quits charging overnight. At first it worked well, but has quit working as well.
","
Easy to use, easy to set up, and looks pretty good too
","
Love how sleek, stylish, and functional this is! Charges fairly fast and is not plastic at all! Fingers crossed it lasts forever! Will for sure be traveling with this. I no longer use anything else to charge my phone!
","
I bought this and an Anker wireless charger at the same time (one for work and one for home) for my new iPhone 11 Pro Max. The Anker one works flawlessly.  This one, however, has no idea how to charge a phone. I use it at work and I leave it next to me on my desk. When I put my phone down on it the light will change to blue to indicate that it is charging.  Within minutes I’ll see my phone light up so I’ll glance over.  The light is now green and the phone is no longer charging... or is it? The phone itself says “charging” so I leave the phone alone for a few hours. I come back and the phone has not charged one bit.  I reposition it so the light turns blue but it just turns green again when I’m not looking. This happens every time I use it.  Luckily my new iPhone battery lasts all day so I don’t actually need to charge at work. The charger was faulty straight out of the box.  Maybe I got unlucky and received a broken one.  Either way, I recommend the Anker one over this one.
","
Great not to have to plug in every time for charging.  With this device, we just set the phone down and forget it.  We've bought two now for work and home.  Works great!
","
Dont charge as fast
","
I used it for wireless charging of headphones and for my Samsung cell. It did really great. I will probably get an extra one to keep at work. I like just being able to pick up my phone and not deal with cords.
","
This TOZO charger is slim, stylish, and works great. My iPhone recognizes it right away and it charges my phone quickly. It works just as well as my mophie wireless charger, but since this has a more sleek design I have it in my living room. I also love the blue/green light letting me know when my phone is charged. This is an amazing wireless charger for the price.
","
Works as expected and charges my iPhone12 fast. Even works threw my Otter box phone case! The LED lights are a little bright at night, but this is easily fixed with a properly places phone.
","
Good price and quality, very recommended.
","
I just received the charger today and will see how it goes. I am happy with y purchase so far! And excited to use it.It looks amazing, very stylish and is charging well so far! :D
","
My iPhone 12 max pro will show it’s charging and still be on the same battery percentage after hours. Tried with case off and didn’t make a difference
","
It is very slim line and the glass like finish is easy to dist and clean.  The charger is perfect and is very hands free.
","
Fast shipping!  Easy to use, just plug it in and lay your device on it and it starts charging. I love the indicator lights that let you know when your device it’s fully charged.
","
I've had it only one day.  Works well so far
","
Extremely easy to use and looks really cute. It’s also lightweight and perfect to just stick in your bag and go.So far it  charge is well and works great!!
","
Easy to use, love the slim line fearing. Charges quickly. I purchased two so my phone stays charged no matter where I am!  One stays at home and one goes with me.
","
Been using this charger for any two weeks now.  I have an Android and my son has an iPhone and it works great with both phones.  No complaints.
","
This charges my new iPhone quickly, and it's pretty too.
","
I can’t believe I waited so long to get a wireless charger! This is so sleek and convenient for travel. What a great product! I am no longer using any wires and have these scattered throughout my house.
","
At first I loved it, just plop it on it n it changes don’t have to worry about the cord being long enough! Bad part is it takes awhile to charge !
","
Love everything about this charger , it charges my phone very fast I will be buying this charger as birthday gift 🎁I just didn’t like the free used up gift that doesn’t work which they send me
","
Affordable. Easy to use. Doesn’t charge very fast, but I like it. I am in and out of an office all day, and it’s great for that. This is the first wireless charger I’ve ever bought. I was skeptical about it initially but it works as advertised. I keep my Spigen case on my iPhone XS and it still charges.
","
Does not work with popsocket.The official popsocket charger is $30 & has a hole for your popsocket. This one looks so cute, I was hoping it would work.
","
This is a very elegant charger. I like the lights on it and also the design. It has a glossy lacquer finish which blends in perfectly with my white Decor. I love the performance of it as well.
","
Easy to use.
","
I love this pad because of the slim design and the fact I don't have to plug in a power cord to charge my phone, I just sit my phone on this device and it charges with no issues.......love it
","
Like the sleek look easy to use. Worked with my phones popsocket attached.
","
Works okay but if not on just right or if it moves it won’t charge. Woke up several mornings with no charge at all. Have to double check the connection.
","
Estético, fácil de usar, durable, carga AirPods y IPhone!Me encanto!
","
This charger charges both sets of my earphones at the same time and works great. I set them to charge when I go to bed  and they are ready to go in the morning.
","
Love it, works great and super easy to use. Only issue is I use a magnetic phone holder on my vehicle dashboard and I have to remove the magnet panel from my phone to change.
","
easy to use, Green lights shows when station is empty or device is fully charged. Easy to locate in the dark. Blue light when device is charging.
","
I bought the charger so it would it be easier for me. Ihad a stroke a few years ago and my left arm and leg are kinda messed up,so not having to mess with wiresto plug in to charge my stuff is very helpful to me.
","
Works good. My phones charging port stopped working consistently. Was tired of waking up in the morning to a phone not charged. Bought this and it’s saved me from having to repair my phone or get a new one
","
Works well
","
This is my favorite wireless charging pad so far and I have been through a few.  I love the magnetic feature as it aligns itself and starts charging immediately no matter how I place it.
","
Good for the price but it very fragile I dropped mine off my night stand and now it will not work
","
Nice product
","
The wireless charger works great.
","
Love this wireless charger. Needed something for work to use my cellphone but not take up my port and this is perfect. Love the color changing lights to indicate it’s charging or not. Love the flat sleek look. And ever better love the price.
","
Surly a must buy wireless charger
","
I purchased one of these to try out on my S9+ as I wanted something flat rather than the angle charger. I was happy that it would charge through my case and purchased two more.
","
I found that this wireless charger shows an almost identical charge time as my high speed corded charger for my SGS9+.  Just make sure to use the power supply that is recommended.
","
The charges doesn’t  charge fast (which everyone hates) and it’s so hard to find the spot where it will charge. I spent like 5 minutes trying to set my phone on it and it took forever to find it then took forever to charge
","
I really love this charger!! I have an iPhone so it makes it easy for me to charge wherever I need at home without all the cords
","
I was having difficulty charging my iphone 11, seems like all my connectors were undependable.... so ordered wireless charger.... pluged it end, laid phone on charger and we are charging!!  love things that work.
","
Cons - It’s not a fast charger. The phone has to be kept in certain orientation for it to charge.Pros - Slim and has green/blue rim light that tells whether phone is charging or not.
","
I got as a gift to my teenage grand son, he says he loves it and the iPhone 11 charges fast on it so all in all of say it's just wonderful.... Probably a good idea as a Xmas gift....
","
I use this wireless charger in my nightstand to charge my phone at night. It’s very cool and high tech looking which is what I was interested in. Works great!
","
What can I say it works. I really like the led indicators, makes it easier to tell when your phone is done charging.
","
I had a problem getting the charger to work. I am sure I simply hadn’t read the enclosed information. When I emailed asking for assistance the response was prompt and spot on.
","
I just bought my first phone with wireless charging and this charger paired with it has provided a solid experience so far. Couldn't be more happy with my purchase and would purchase again if needed.
","
My wife loves this product for the easy convenience.  Thank you
","
Very accessible and convenient. Great product.
","
Delivered on time, the wireless charger looks nice.
","
The wireless charger works very well. However, if you have a push button on the back of your phone, the phone and the wireless charger can not connect with each other. If I take my phone case off the wireless charger works as if should.  Just aheads up to anyone that has button or something on the back of their phone.
","
Work's perfect. Customer service is excellent. The little piece of paper that provides instructions is so tiny I can't read even with a magnifying glass. I had to contact customer service to solve my problem.
","
sleek design that does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Packable, and fast charging.  this one is the best of the many that I have bought.  changing all wires around the house to charge pads..
","
I was amazed by how small and compact it is. Easy to take anywhere. I can even put it in my purse, plus different colors to choose from.
","
I just love this charger plug it in and just set it on the plate and get up whenever you wanted to charge. Love the ease of use!
","




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I wanted a charger that would work through a thick phone case. I also have a magnet in my case for a car mount. This wireless charger is able to charge through the case and magnet.
","
Bought this for my Tozo earbuds.  Very thin and works as described.
","
About the size of a drinks coaster. Charges quickly and indicator lights change color when charging starts and ends. Bought 2. Easy to set up and use, does not get hot.
","
This wireless charger is both useful and good looking. I purchased it for my new Note 10 Plus, and it charges the phone fully overnight. The slim design is great, and very unobtrusive in my space. Just make sure you put the center of the phone in the middle of the charger, and forget about it until you need to grab your phone!
","
Very sleek. Looks great on countertop.
","
Great price. I like the sleakness of it, very thin. The colors of blue and green are nice visually as it changes from charging and not. Perfect charger for my office.
","
Likes : design, color, speedy shipping & value for money.Dislikes: nothing so far.Wishes: I just wished the USB cable also matched the color of wireless charger :). Not sure if I'm asking more ;)
","
Seems to work awesome -  used it right away and it charged my phone in no time, and has 2 small lights on the surface so you know when it’s plugged in and the light color changes when it’s charging something! Works through my phone case also
","
Got it today. It’s very sleek and seems to charge my AirPods Pro through its silicone case. Love the way it looks! Will update once I’ve used it a while.
","
Bought two.  One was a gift and she loves it.  The other was for me and I really like it.  Use the proper USB/AC converter.
","
Works great even though my case
","
Got this a few days ago and have been using it since it was delivered. Works exactly as described and it charged my phone overnight with zero problems. It didn't get hot like some other wireless chargers. The price is great and it makes charging a phone easier and you don't have to wear out the charging port. Highly recommend this brand!
","
I am in love with this little charging device!! It’s very convenient, works great, and even stops charging when your device is at 100% which is better for the battery! It’s also super cute. The one I have is white with rose gold and I love the little lights that indicate wether it’s charging or ready to charge!
","
Not a fan - It has a hard time charging my iPhone
","
Great product. Just as I expected.
","
I love the minimalist look, better than regular cord charging by my bedside.  did learn that it works with a plug and not just the cord plugged into a usb charger.
","
Headline says all
","
Just replaced my old one that was bulky and you had to strong arm it to make it activate and charge. I love this one and intend to buy one for my mom and office and well.
","
It does exactly what it is supposed to do. It charges my Samsung Galaxy s10e phone quickly. I use it every night.
","
Thin and seems to charge well.
","
Charger has an awesome design. It’s small, flat and stylish as described and I like that the connection is a USB-C.But looks can be deceiving.The issue I am running into is having to place my device in a perfect position several times before it will charge. Additionally, sometimes it will say it’s charging my phone, then after a few minutes the green light flashes and I have to reposition. It’s more if a pain than simply plugging in my phone in with an actual wired charger.
","
The charger works perfectly.  It indicates green when first plugged in the as the device is charging it glows blue.  The charging speed is about an hour to an hour and a half depending on how much charge is needed.  It charges my phone from about 15% to 100% in the 1.5 hour range.  Overall very durable and great quality.
","
This charger is very this and stylish. I like that it’s a usb-c connection. I would definitely recommend this product. Just make sure that you have the correct power adaptor for your cord.
","
So it doesn’t charge your phone fast at all, plus it’s much less convenient than a cord since you can’t really hold your phone while its charging. A cool product but doesn’t really deliver great results
","
I was one of those people who thought getting a wireless charging pad was a waste of  money. But I have been converted! Super convenient and easy to use! It lights up green when you put your phone on and turns blue when it's at 100%. It will also stop charging once it hits a 100% which I also like. Well worth the money!
","
I love this charger! It is extremely thin, sleek, and perfect for sitting on my desk at work without getting in the way. I have used this for both my iPhone X and second generation Air Pods with a wireless charging case, and both charge easily while in a case. The color changing feature between blue and green is a nice touch.
","
This is great for overnight charging. It's not as fast as fast charging but it's still decent. Im also pretty sure it stops charging once your phone reaches 100% as the light is blue when charging and green when it isnt and I always wake up to find the light green. It's super lightweight so very portable .
","
It doesn't work with my iPhone 13 pro max, and it also doesn't work on my TOZO wireless earbuds.  I have left the earbuds on the charger for over a day and while it says it is charging, my earbuds never charge.  I have loved my TOZO earbuds, but this wireless charger was a waste of money.
","
So lightweight and thin! It's easy to pack and travel with. Plus it's so much more convenient to just lay my phone down rather than needing to plug it in.
","
This product is great and sleek! Perfect for traveling or just keeping on your desk/nighstand. It blends in well with any decorations on desks and charges fast. I have been looking for one of these wireless charges and this is great! Definitely recommend!
","
My only complaint is that it’s hard to see the light change colors once the phone is charging when the phone is in certain positions. Because the lights on top go halfway around the circumference.
","
That has the light that tells you if your phone is in the right place for the charge to work.  When used right, it’s great.  But learn how to use it.
","
Charges slow when you can get it to charge. Need to position phone on disk just right or you won't get a charge. SMH
","
I like the aesthetic look of it. It is very easy to use and works perfect for my iPhone 12 and my Tozo ear buds. Great indicator light that is green when plugged up then turns blue when charging an item.
","
This charger is slim and works perfectly.  We purchased one a few weeks back and it worked so well on our iPhone we purchased a second one.  The very subtle side lights are also a great feature.  They turn soft green when the phone (or whatever product you are charging) is fully charged.  Worth the money.
","
Great product and cool design
","
Love the size.  The magnet is pretty strong too.  Great design.  It is prefect for my desk or the countertop.  You can also hold it while charging.  Very cool!
","
I use this for my iPhone 8 with an Otterbox commuter case & it works great & charges fast. No complaints at all
","
I bought this for our AirBnB guests and my wife tried her iPhone Xs with a pop socket installed and to our surprise, it works!The time to charge may be reduced because of the pop socket increasing the optimal charge distance, but heh it works.The look and feel is posh and sleek.  The Qi pad is slim.
","
Did exactly what I was looking for. Should have bought another!
","
Clean looking product. As described
","
Its very nice and slick every thing you could ask for in a charger
","
Love this thing.
","
So far this charger has worked well for my needs.  I have no complaints.  It’s sleek and unobtrusive on my desk. I like that I can charge my phone and my AirPods with the same device.
","
Very elegant design, feels Apple quality. You will not be disappointed the super shiny glass top. Works well in an office environment as well as in the home. Buy and enjoy!
","
I bought a wireless charger for my cell phone since other chargers I have purchased stopped working after short use.  I am happy that out of the packaging is this wireless option is working for me.
","
I love this product! Now I have a charger for my room and can use the wire one in my car! I could also use the wireless in the car as well! Thank you!!!
","
Nice size. Perfect to travel. But it takes a long time to charge.
","
I use this at my desk at work. I come in and just throw the phone on top of it and when I leave I don't have to worry about my phone dying on the commute home. Looks cool and I have the wire hidden so I don't see it, unlike the lightning wire that would always be on my desk previously.
","
I got this with the Tozo 12 wireless earbuds and it works great with the charging case.
","
Definitely worth every bit of the money! If not more! I’ve been going strong with it for almost half a year.. and no issues so far. Charging speed isn’t as fast as apple charger.
","
I have a thick case that has liquid and glitter and if u position the phone just right .. it will charge through it. So far so good
","
I was looking to purchase a wireless charger to compliment the my new phone. They have many color options to make sure you pick the right one. I am very happy!
","
I can have my phone on it all night and it will get 30% charged. Maybe my case it to big, I don't know but if you have an otter box on your phone do not buy this product. And I bought 4.
","
I love my new charger!
","
This is a really nice charger and especially for the price you get it I can’t wait to use it all the time! And the color is so nice
","
It’s so easy to use and with compatible  devices and compatible phone case you can easily charge at any time without hassling with the wires/ searching for the wires. Good one when babies are around. Less wires less danger.
","
This item works great for my war buds, shipped quick , won't charge my Samsung 9plus but charges my pods quick
","
Would always run my phone down because having to mess with the phone cover every time was a PITA.  Now I simply drop my phones (both an S20 and iPhone 11) on this and go.
","
Nice to have a wireless charger for in the living room,  only thing that would make it better would be if it tilted.
","
I love this charger. It’s small so it fits perfectly on my bedside table. Gives a fast full charge. I highly recommend.
","
These work great on my night stand.  I own 2 of them
","
The most beautiful I’ve seen and it works great! The only downside is that the lights bother my sleep at night. I’d love if they have one sleek and pretty like that but with no lights.
","
I like the look and the sturdy feel.
","
I love my charging pad. I just lay my phone down and come back, pick it up and it’s recharged without having to plug it in. Awesome gadget!
","
It does the job & it’s nicely packaged.
","
Love the Rose color
","
The charger is working great. This one replaced a Brookstone wireless charger that was not reliable right out of the box. I’m very happy with this purchase and would recommend very much.
","
I love the design of this charger.I wish that it charged faster and did not use USB-C and used Micro-usb.
","
Very good product , the quality is excellent, I will buy more for family members as a gift.Producto muy bueno , la calidad es excelente , voy a comprar más cargadores para mis familiares .
","
Not really worth buying, it doesn’t charge at all sometimes overnight or charges half way. It sure looks good but it’s very efficient like a wire charger.
","
My charger worked great for about a week and a half and then started to fail. It blinks light blue/dark blue after about 10 seconds of my phone sitting on it. I found out the hard way that it stopped working when my phone didn’t charge at all over night. I’ve tried unplugging, plugging back in (obviously) but that doesn’t do anything. I bought this same charger for my husband for Christmas and his still works great. I put my phone on it just to check that there isn’t an issue with my phone case interfering with the wireless charge but it charges on his just fine. I think I received a bad charger. The company’s tech support link through Amazon takes me to a page that’s not found on their website so I’m hoping this message is seen by them so I can request a replacement. I’ll update if the customer service is smooth so others know what happens in a situation like this.
","
You get what you pay for. It's not a fast charging wireless charger. Really only good for letting your phone charge while you sleep.
","
This does work to charge your phone/wireless charging device -- but we warned it does NOT fast charge. Expect it to take 6-8 hours (overnight). I have a Samsung S8+ for reference.
","
Fantastic wireless charger. There are 2 green lights that are always on on the surface of the charger, but they are not overly bright and do not interfere with our sleep. The provided charge cable is sufficient length, and the rose gold version looks great on my fiancée's nightstand.
","
Works perfect for my ol Pixel 3. Simple yet beautiful design. This one has only a small LED that's not too bright so perfect for the night stand.
","
Charges slow
","
Awesome charger all my guest use it all the time. I have it in my living room for that reason, great product and I recommend it.
","
Great purchase so far.  Originally bought to charge earphones, but perfect for my phone!  So glad I purchased and hope it continues to perform for me!
","
This product isn’t what I thought, went to return and missed the return window by two days unfortunately. This is particular on how you lay the phone to charge, I can’t always locate the right spot and then the phone doesn’t charge. Dislike that there was no charging cable and I had to buy my own. So this cost twice the amount since I had to buy a cord and now it’s not even working like I expected. I should just be able to lay it down and have it charge. Nice concept but not a nice product overall.
","
Great, sleek charger, looks nice and charges fast
","
Came with USB cable, and has a very fancy look to it.  The LED lights turn from green to purple when charging. I’d like that because it lets me know I set it on correctly. I would easily buy this again.
","
Obsessed with this! My husband always forgets to charge his phone at night and so I bought him a wireless charger and it’s exactly what he needed! I also love that they give you different color options, I picked gold to match our bedroom decor. Love it!
","
Slow to charge
","
Great for at-home or on-the-go! It's about as thin as a cardboard box, which is cool. Takes up almost no space on my desk. I also like that it comes in white, since most wireless chargers are black.
","
Works how i wanted it to, it charges through my case which i am happy about. The main reason i bought this is i would forget to plug phone in at night but remembering to place on top of charger is easier.
","
Works great for wireless charging! Isn't super fast but I like to use it on my desk while I am working.
","
I love this charger and going to purchase more to have in every room.  I also love the ear buds and will have those in every room as well!!
","
This works great. Thin, light, easy to carry for travel. Love it.
","
Super convenient nightstand charger for my iPhone. Takes up hardly any space, and looks great. I might put a few throughout the house so I don't need to track down the proper cable for guests when they need to charge their devices.
","
This charger is awesome. I can put my phone on it at night or whenever and it charges so quickly.
","
I love it
","
Like that I am able to use this wireless charger with a case and finger hold.  One of the few wireless chargers I found that I was able to use with accessories attached to the phone.
","
Just got the new IPhone 11, heard about wireless chargers, Looked for one that had style and quality,  I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and how easy this works, no more reaching for cord just I s easy step of placing phone on charger deck. The colored lights when not charging and when charging give it a better look
","
So far so good...
","
I love how thin and sleek this this wireless charger looks and feels! It charges my phone fast as well! I plan on purchasing one for those in my family. Thanks for a great product!
","
It’s so nice and light that you don’t have to worry about any added weight. It has amazing charging power and you finally don’t have to worry about your charger breaking due to a bent wire.
","
Nice charger for a great price! Wasn’t sure if it would work but it started charging the second I placed my earbuds on it! Very satisfied and love the convenience of it!
","
Gave it as a present and the recipient says it works great.
","
This was really cheap so I'm not really too upset about it. The charger works and is very slim so excellent for travel. But it charges incredibly slow and my phone gets pretty hot. So it's not something I would use regularly.
","
I honestly didn’t think it would charge through my phone case, but it did! I only wish it would’ve came with its own adapter. Besides from that, I’m so glad I heard of this item recently and bought it.
","
So excited for my new charger - it is white on top with pink gold trim around sides. Looks great with furniture and is slim disc-like - so good. No more plugging in each night. Love it.
","
Small quick charger and you can leave phone case on.
","
Some times it doesn’t get a great connection to the phone. I tested with and without the case and still sometimes it doesn’t connect.
","
Works great for my constant back and forth to my desk (30+ times a day it seems). Keeps my phone topped off quickly and easily.
","
This charger works great. When it is plugged in there are green LEDs that illuminate and when you charge your phone it gives a soft audio tone and turns blue to let you know your phone is charging.
","
When coupled with the right power block, this charges nice and fast. It looks great too!
","
This wireless charger was exactly what I was looking for. It looks nice and sleek as well as does its job perfectly. My original Apple charger kept overheating and I was scared to use it so this charger was the perfect addition.
","
Really nice. I got this to go with my ear buds. Works well. I have no issues with this and I hope when I get a phone that charges wirelessly this will work.
","
My iPhone 10 would not charge with the regular lightning port anymore. This charging station solved that issue. Works great
","
I just opened it and am very impressed! Sleek and stylish design, very portable. Seems very easy to use while working and being busy. I can’t speak for charging power yet, but already exited!!
","
The LEDs are VERY bright at night. recommend the manufacture dim at night.... make sure you turn the phone 90 degrees perpendicular to the charging port to cover up the lights otherwise it will glow up your room.
","
I love how modern this looks on my bedstand, and how easy it is to use, no more plugging and unplugging my phone to charge it. It also doubles as a lovely nightlight, but it's not so bright that it bothers me at all. The lights change from green to blue when it's charging. I'm very glad I got this!
","
I love this charger, looks super nice and it's very cool. However, sometimes I set my charger on it and I can hear to charging noice click on and off every minute or so. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and the charger has only charged my phone like 20%. When I go to sleep, I need to rely on this charger to fully charge my phone every night.  I'm not getting that peace of mind right now.
","
What's not to like? Plug it in (using your own USB power port because this does not come with one) and put your compatible phone down on the pad. Lights turn blue to indicate charging. No more messing with cords! And at a great price.
","
I got two of these chargers for my boyfriend and myself for Christmas. They're a fantastic build quality and pair seamlessly with all of our wireless charging devices, including my Tozo headphones and his Samsung headphones. The best purchase!!
","
This charger works great. I use it to charge my Galaxy S9+ phone and my Bluetooth earbuds. Charges my phone faster than I expected from a wireless charger.
","
Plug it in and it works.
","
Loved it, looks cute on my nightstand.. not that fastest charger but perfect as I use it for over night so it doesn’t need to be instantaneous.  Highly recommend and at a good price point too.
","
So far works great, less cords on the desk so everyone can drop their device and charge... we have multiple devices (Pixel, I-phone, etc.)  Now if the Fire tablets would only support this type of charging...
","
This charger has a really sleek look and is easy to use. I do not have to worry about breaking a charging cord again. this charger also looks good in my room since it is glass with a little bit of color.
","
Really neat charger, it does fast charge for ten seconds and then regular charge the after that. So, technically it is not a fast wireless charger.This is not a fast wireless charger no matter what power brick you use.
","
Doesn't work through my average sized case.
","
What I love about this product is how slim it is. It not bulky like other ones. It’s easy to travel with. I brought it to work and it’s not in the way of things. I also love that we can get different colors we can get. I’ve only had it for a day but I love it so far!
","
Why did I wait so long before trying this wireless charge disc? It makes charging my iPhone so easy, and I love the color. It was as described and I couldn’t be happier!
","
Great product. Flat just like the picture, has a grip on it which is very nice. Just so you know if you have a pop socket or anything like that it won’t charge the phone you have to take the case off
","
The look of it is awesome. Simply place it on your desk make your life upgrade.Small size won’t take too much space out of the desk.
","
It does the job
","
Have no problems
","
Charges up the iPhone 11 pro fast with a thick case on the phone. I also selected this one because I did not want lights bothering me at night. Although there are two lights on top, these become invisible once you place the phone on top of the charger (the phone covers the lights completely). Would buy this product again.
","
So far.  So good.
","
I love the feel of it. I chose this one in my wife's favorite color: rose gold. It is great because the rubber inserts under it make sure that it does not slip out of place.
","
Charges slow, but convenient if you take your phone on and off the charger often.
","
This sleek attractive charger is working great with both my new Tozo T6 earbuds and my new iPhone 12! Charging seems strong. I’m very impressed with the TOZO products. I would highly recommend this brand of products.
","
It is super easy to use and it does charge right away.
","
I have all sorts of electronic devices and it foes not work for any of them
","
It works. The only bummer thing about this is that you need to position your phone a certain way, otherwise it doesn’t charge. I thought I could just lay it on there and walk away, nope.
","
This is very attractive, flat and thin so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  My negatives would be the charging cord is a little too short.  Also it takes forever for my iphone to charge when on this pad.
","
Received the item it was in perfect condition when opened the charger was super thin which I really liked. I tried it out and it charged my phone at relative good speed. This would definitely be a good tech gift.
","
QI CERTIFIED!! (Which the Amazon add said nothing about) Love it. Very sleek and shiny. GREAT free warranty included in packaging. The white is an iPhone-white, and not a reflective mirror coating like the pictures look. Might get a grey one with this warranty bonus. Hoping that might be more reflective. Will keep posted!!
","
This wireless charger is great I have a note 9 in a punkcase with a pop socket and because of the 10w power it is able to still charge my phone wirelessly.Construction is great aluminum with a non slip top and feet.Only complaint is it does not come with a power brick just the usb c cable
","
So beautiful and so easy to use! this charger is everything it says it is. Doesn't come with a USB block but includes the charging cord and charging pad which is everything you need!
","
The TOZO W1 wireless charger looks far better then the other wireless chargers that I have in house. It is working great and have enough power to charge my Samsung phone. Recommend this product to everyone interested.
","
So far it's an excellent product!! It charges my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 just as fast as the original Samsung Wireless charger usimg the fast charging adapter.
","
nice
","
I love this sleek little charger. I wanted to keep my phone on my nightstand in case of those dreaded midnight kids' calls, but I didn't want to have a cord to yank on and get tangled up in. Now my phone is easily accessible and always at full charge. I'd like another one for the office and the downstairs. Goodbye charging cables!
","
Easy to use and very useful.
","
I love this charger.  I use as a ""during the day"" charger when I'm at my desk and my phone is sitting next to me.  It's very slim and unobtrusive.  I can also charge my Galaxy Earbuds (but not the watch).
","
I like that it doesn’t look inexpensive.
","
Bought this for use with iPhones. Charges fast, doesn't heat up. A great value compared to Apple's prices. Works well with the magnets in iPhones.
","
Works pretty well but the magnet is weak and charges slow.  I’d rather charge on a cord in half the time.
","
I'm loving it so far. It's thin and sits on my desk during work right now. Not only does it charge well but it looks real look really nice. I definitely would recommend buying this product
","
Nice thin flat design. It has led indicator on the charger that is not too bright and it works with my phone case on.
","
I just bought this for iphone 11. It works as expected. It is extremely thin and adds to the asthetics of my desk. Would recommend for anyone looking for small factor, portable wireless charger. Just note that it doesn't come with a power plug, you need to have your own. It supports the fast charging if your plug supports it.
","
Super easy to use and requires no setup. It charges very fast, which I appreciate! It looks good, and it gives prompt feedback about whether it is charging, finished charging, or has a misaligned connection.
","
I got this hoping for a nice charger that will charge my phone. Unfortunately I’m not really liking it, it charges VERY slow, and today I woke up to find it just stopped charging in the middle of the night. That is it’s one job! It really is only useful if you want it to look aesthetic, because you can’t really hold your phone while it’s charging with this one.
","
I like the convenience.  Everyone can use the same charger.
","
First time using a wireless charger and works great! Charges my iPhone 8 with the case on. Choose this charger because of a friend’s recommendation who would give it 5 stars and they had issues with wireless chargers from other companies so I trusted this company. Packing was impressive and sturdy but yet compact and protected the product perfectly.
","
The new W6 model is smaller and of higher quality. I like the included USB-C to USB adapter as well. There are also no distracting LED lights.
","
This wireless charger was smaller that I expected, but is really efficient. It charges up my iPhone rather quickly and I haven’t noticed any over heating issues as of yet.
","
I've had this product for a few days now and it's charging as expected. I like the charging indicator lights. It would be cool if it could indicate when charging is complete but it's not required ... unless it does and I haven't figured it out yet.
","
This was a very easy set up; love this product!
","
Great product! I’ve Always had very good experience with Tazo. This thin sturdy elegant wireless charger is perfect for me! Charges fast, doesn’t slip on surface it’s sitting on, love the led light. I also have wireless ear buds made by tazo and they are awesome!
","
I've only had it for a short time, but it has been charging very quickly and is very easy to transport any where I need it to go.
","
High quality. Works as described. I ordered the rose gold and its so pretty to look at so I don’t have an issue leaving the charger out all the time. It jus becomes part of the kitchen counter.
","
So small and easy to use! Works great! Instructions could use an update: nowhere in the package did it tell me how it would display once the item was charged.
","
Really show charge. Its frustrating. I have a pixel 3 and it says fast charge but it takes a long time. Great customer service though
","
I've only used this for a few days but it works well so far. I have a two-layer phone case (rubber skin and hard plastic outer shell) and wasn't sure that wireless charging would work, but it works perfectly.
","
Fantastic charger. Smaller than my hand, no set up, even charges through the pop socket I have on the back of a very thick, bamboo case. Extremely pleased. So please I purchase three more for my girlfriend and parents!
","
Absolutely the best charger I’ve used. Takes up almost no space and changes color to let you know when you are charging. It even charges through my case.
","
Immediately worked with iphone 12  Came with usb c adaptor.Feels solid. Looks good.  Good value for magnetic charging.Got the white one -  Works 100% with Otterbox Magsafe case.
","
This charger is fantastic! It’s compact, but works perfectly. It even charges my phone through my case & phone grip! I absolutely love it & will be buying more for my family.
","
My previous Qi charger was pretty picky about my phone's position, so sometimes I would wake up and it wouldn't be charged.  Hasn't happened yet with these.  Works great, highly recommended!
","
I’ve only had this product for a few days but so far, it’s been great. Looks good on my desk and charges efficiently. It also doesn’t get hot or make any noise. Very satisfied with the purchase. **Update: I have now had the charger for three weeks. I am still very satisfied with my purchase. Charges fast and doesn't get hot when charging***
","
Easily charge my phone by setting it down on the charging pad
","
I’ve heard about wireless charging, but never really experienced it until I purchased the Tozo. Holy cow! I don’t know what I’ve been missing! Easy to use, no messy wires, fast charging...and cheaper than a charging cable and block! Thanks Tozo!
","
Small.  No room for anything after iPhone is on it.  No big deal for the price.
","
This wireless charger is very sleek and very well made.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 10 plus and it charged it very quickly.  I bought it to charge my wifes TOZO earbuds which works very well with them but I liked it so much I need to buy another one.  Can't beat this product for the price!!!!
","
I was under impression it would charge a tablet. Not correct info given!
","
I got this to charge my wireless earbuds and it worked great for a few days. Now the light is flashing green indicating that the device is not compatible with the earbuds.
","
I read several reviews before buying this one in todays deals. Works good with cover on. Have Galaxy s8, is not a fast charge. Took cover off. Still slow. Plug gets hotter than any other battery chargers I use.
","
This particular item was already open and looked liked it was used and someone else fingerprints on it.. my other was in a sealed package like everything else not a bit happy about that
","
When it said wireless charger it means it works like any other charging pad and your phone isn’t connected by a cord but the word wireless in the name leaves the impression that the charging pad can be charged and unplugged to charge your phone without the pad being plugged in. Disappointed in that since I feel it’s misleading. Otherwise works fine. I wanted it for travel but it won’t work for what I need because it isn’t really wireless.
","
I have 3 of these, all used with iPhone 8. They are fast, slim and are basically invisible in the room. So far, no issues.
","
Plug and play item. No issues, classy looking and works perfectly, even with my phone case on. Which also has my drivers license, credit cards! charges right through them all. Any other chargers i have found will not, i have  to remove my case which is a pain. i will be ordering a few more of these.
","
Just received this charger today, so my thoughts may change, but so far I really like it. Easy to set-up and use, what more can you ask for?
","
Bought for my husband. He loves it. Only issue is you cannot update your phone at night with it. Have to plug in to regular charger for that!
","
So far so good. This is such a cool little charger. I have a iPhone 10x with a silicon cover and I just lay it on the charger, charger turns blue and that means it’s charging. Super easy and a great look. And I’ll definitely bring it with me when I travel. It isn’t the fastest charger in the world but it does the job.
","
This is a fantastic charger! It is super slim and sleek.  We have it on our counter and it looks nice as well.  Charges through a card case on my phone.
","
This charging pad is the first one we could find that will actually charge the phone through a thick phone case.  I have given it as a gift to others and they all just rave about it.  Highly recommend!
","
Really portable and excellent for travel. Great value for the price, just wish it came with a wall adapter and not just a cord, but I had one from another cord that I could borrow.
","
This is my favorite wireless charger I've bought so far. It is light weight, powerful and easy to use. It looks good also. I would purchase again.
","
Easy to use
","
I bought these for myself and my husband. They charge quickly. I thought the light would be too bright for my bedroom at night but it’s really not.
","
I like these status lights on top to indicate when it starts charging. The design is innovative with it's elegant slim base. Looks and works great at a great price!
","
Great for price. I love the slim design and size of the product. I don’t have to worry about trying to center my phone on it like the more expensive Samsung wireless charger. The lights on the side of the charger do get annoying though. They are quite bright and can almost act as a night light haha.
","
So much better than expected!! This is such an amazing charging pad! Funny enough it even charges my airpod pros!! I love the cute pink color and the change in led light to let you know that it is charging! Would and probably will purchase again!
","
I really like the glass too, the LED charging indicators and the overall sleek looking design. I wouldn’t want to have this in the bedroom, though, due to the brightness of the LEDs. I’m not in a hurry, so cannot comment on how fast the charger works. For optimal charging rates, one needs a special high-current charger, I believe.
","
The charging plate is so lightweight and easy to use for traveling. I can even use it for my phone which is great. I brought this in addition to the headphones and it was a great.
","
This is a very sleek looking wireless charger that works as expected for a very reasonable price. There was one small issue I had with the one I received however. The light indicator had uneven lighting which was more aesthetic and did not affect the way the charger worked. I emailed TOZO's customer service and they said they would send a replacement which I appreciate.
","
This has happened on several occasions, it will indicate that it’s charging with a blue light, but I’ll wake up and it’ll still be at 12 percent! Not only that but it slips and slides so easy on the phone, absolutely no grip at all! The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because it’s very affordable.
","
This charger works great! All I do is place my phone down and it charges. Couldn’t have asked for a better product!
","
So easy to use!  I have it on the table by the sofa.  If the phone rings, I don’t have to get up to answer it.  I just pick it and start talking.
","
Bought an extra one to leave at work! Now my battery is never running low 👍🏾
","
This product is really cool, it is small, it chargers my iPhone through the case with no issues as well as my TOZO headsets, which btw are also great. Totally recommend this product
","
10/10 would recommend. It's beautiful and effective. They also have great customer service. My first one was faulty but I was able to get another one that works fantastically.
","
It is so great not having to try and plug in my IPhone in the dark anymore! I really like this wireless charger and it has a really low light so it doesn’t disturb our sleep.
","
a great product. just charges kind of slow
","
Wonderful charger, beautiful design and works almost flawlessly. The only issue is with Apple Airpods Pro, the case doesn’t charge unless the actual Airpods are removed. Other than that, great product!
","
Does what it says and is very efficient. Looks sleek and very portable. Great Product. Highly recommend

 Amazingly convenient and simple to install. Beautiful and sleek. Easy to carry around. I have a few laying around the house so my husband and I can always have our phone charging on standby.
","
Great looking white wireless charger.
","
I purchased for my husband. This charger works great and was easy to set up. I really loved the look.  The gold trim made it a very classy looking charger. I only made one mistake which was not realizing my husband’s phone was not the correct model, but I was able to purchase an adapter :https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082B73785?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share.
","
Love that i can lay my phone down to charge. Charges with the cases on as well.
","
Charging power is good for my iPhone 12mini. Reasonable size for traveling and very easy to use, just rest the phone and it attaches itself to the base. Very easy to detach.
","
The quality of Tozo products really can't be beat especially for the price. I've had great success from their wireless headphones and this wireless charger appears to be on track to be just as good of a value. Highly recommend.
","
A very slow charger
","
Seems comparable to the Apple charger for about 50% of the cost. I don’t have a way to measure the charging wattage but the build and magnetic strength is similar to the Apple MagSafe charger.
","
My husband just ordered and received this wireless charger. It was very easy to use and so far he loves it. He can use it for all of his wireless devices. He has had a wonderful experience with TOZO products in the past and wanted to give this one a try.
","
Have only used it once, but so far, no complaints
","
Bought the gold plate color, which looks fantastic. It has light indicator on the top which is green when not in use and blue when charging. It also comes with a 1 year warranty in the box, make sure to register it.Works very well even if you are using back screen protector or pop socket. Highly recommend this product.
","
Replaced our cord charger with this convenient and attractive wireless charger. The misses loves it too and we’re both designers, so that’s saying a lot. I wish there wasn’t a status light but that’s just me. It looks great.
","
We’ve only had it a few days but so far my husband loves it. Easy to use and charges his iPhone so quickly! And it looks so sleek! If my husbands holds up we may order more.
","
It just stopped working after a week.Looks cool but is worth what you pay which is nothing.
","
Very satisfied with this charger as it charges my phone faster than I expected. I'm very impressed with the instantaneous charging. Within a split second of setting it down, my phone is charging.It is rather stylish as well.
","
This wireless charger works great with my Samsung Galaxy S10 through the case.  It also charges using fast wireless charging, so it doesn't take much longer than when plugged in directly to the wall.  The charger is very thin and sleek, looks great on my nightstand.  Bought a second one for the other nightstand!  Would definitely recommend.
","
Well made product and higher quality than expected. Charges iPhone 13 quick.
","
I was in need of a charger like this for some time. It is super convenient and charger fairly quickly considering its wireless. I was a little concerned with the indicator light when I initially got the product; but after using that night, the lights never bothered me or kept me up. Overall great product and super easy to use.
","
The charger doesn't work. It barely feeds any power to keep the screen on nevermind add to the battery.
","
I like this wireless charger for traveling because it's small and can fit even in your front pocket and it gives you a quick charge
","
was mid tbh
","
Previous reviews were correct- you need to take out phone case & place the phone at a precise position to charge battery fully.
","
Really simple to use.
","
Ordered bc my other chargers weren’t working well - noticed it bad to do with the port on the phone itself (often wear out in iPhones after sometime). This thing rules and looks so cool.
","
Bought two of these and they work great. Very slim and sleek design, the lights changed color which indicates it’s charging is very convenient. Would probably get more in the future, no more broken charging cords!
","
This charger is amazing.  Put your compatible phone on it it charges quick , then goes in stand by so no over heating,  or charging.....
","
This is easy to use and intuitive. Plug in, set phone on top, and charge. This even charges through my case and a holder on the back, which a different charger would not charge through.
","
Really like how thin it is. Wish they offered the right charger power supply at same time. Want to make sure I’m getting the best charge rate.
","
So far so good. Doesn’t work for watches. But I like that I can keep my phone case on to charge it.
","
This charger is very well made, looks really classy and does a great job of charging my Samsung S21 quickly. Works well even with my phone in a case. Ver pleased.
","
Comes packaged well, doesnt feel real cheap and charges well. Very happy.
","
Product broke in less than 2 months. Just blinks a green light and won’t charge. Tried different cords, blocks and outlets. Just stopped working
","
This is the perfect bedside charger. It’s thin, the light it emits is minimal, and it isn’t terrible to look at on a night stand! Like most wireless chargers, this thing has next to no grip, so it needs to be absolutely flat so your phone doesn’t slide around, especially if you don’t use a case
","
Sits on her countertop and use daily. It’s a great product would buy again but is not a quick charger for phones
","
I was hoping it would charge my phone faster. I put it on at 57% and it first said 1hr 5 min till charged then changes to 1 hrs 38 min.
","
Great value and durable!!
","
I got it couple days ago and so far I like it. Easy to set up (just plug the cord it) and it is ready to use. :) it works great for both on my iPhones.
","
Very good price, simple and easy to use and I like that its flat and not a sit up docking station because it makes it easier to just set something on it and go.
","
Won’t charge my iPhone XR in or out of the case. Waste of money. I needed a new charger, waited days for this to arrive only to be disappointed. It is aesthetically pleasing but I but it to charge a phone not just look nice.
","
Worked for six months. Then turned into a drinks coaster.TOZO saw my post and promised to send me a new one. They did. It works!Thanks, Tozo. ☺
","
Ultra Slim as advertised,  super light weight, very easy to carry around.  The completed charge indicator doesn't always show when the charge is completed but works well either way, I didn't mind so much.  Very aesthetically pleasing on a desk with the super slim form factor.
","
very nice
","
I love how thin the charger is. It has a very nice sleek look and is pleasing to look at. it goes very nicely with my desk and is very easy to use. i love how accessible it is. great product!
","
This is not my first wireless charging pad, but by far the best one.First, on the looks, the design is sleek and the surface of the pad looks cool. It is also compact, lightweight. Moreover the lights are soft to the eyes even at night.Next on the functionality, the phone charges almost instantly and charging speed is also fast. Highly recommend this product.
","
Works great fits iPhone 12 Pro Max like it was built for it. Came with a usb c to usb a adapter to plug into any usb power source.  Very nice.
","
Slim feature and the color changing let's you know it's charging.  Great replacement of the bulky one I had
","
I've had this charger a few months and it is still going strong. I've dropped it and its still held up to my clumsy behaviors. Fast charging and easy to use for my Galaxy S10+
","
This charger works very well, it's fast, easy to use, and easy to travel with. It's also compatible with a lot of brands.
","
Finally upgrading to wireless charging devices and picked Mozo out due to cost and aesthetics.Build quality is impressive and now my apple USB blocks still have a reason for use. Would absolutely recommend for anyone considering wireless charging.
","
Easy install. Works great! Charge does take a little longer but I leave it and come back to it a few hours later and it’s fully charged.
","
The charging power is terrible. I have an iPhone 8+ Placed it on the charger with very low battery(yellow stage) at night, woke up the next morning and it was at 60%. I tested it a few times and it was the same thing. Whereas my cord charger would charge in half the time. I would NOT suggest buying.
","
I love it. The metal and glass construction looks and feels great. It charges my phone as well as any other wireless charger and it doesn't get too hot.
","
I picked this one because the shipping was next day delivery, but I'm glad I did. It's very thin and sleek, and it is charging my phone at a reasonable rate.
","
Wow this thing is great! Rapid charge and has cute little green lights on the top of the white one I received. Waste no more time plugging in your phone when you can just lay it down and BAM!
","
I really liked this for the first few times I used it, but after that for some reason it just stopped charging throughout the night. I would take my phone case off, place it on the charger, make sure I saw the charging icon on my phone, and then go to bed. But when I woke up in the morning the charge indicator was gone and my phone had gained maybe 10-20%. I’m not sure why it suddenly stopped working but it no longer charges consistently, which completely defeats its purpose. Going to return
","
I recently purchased this Tozo wireless charger. It is awesome! The size is perfect, it is nice and thing, doesn't take much room where you place it. It charges our phones quickly! I love Tozo products!
","
My cord connection on my phone was going bad{ I had to find the charging spot) this works and was cheaper than repairing my phone
","
Very slim. Love it! I bought it in white/gold and is the perfect match with my office decor. Easy to use and  lightweight to carry on.
","
Very sleek, has a good weight to it. It’s nice to be able to just set your phone down and have it charge next to the bed. I love the LEDS, and they don’t distract me while sleeping. So far, I really like this product a lot.
","
I wish I had bought this wireless charger sooner. The quality is extremely good for the price. The indicator lights are super helpful, and the design is very sleek. It is definitely worth buying!
","
My wife’s IPad stopped charging with the traditional plug type charger. This charger was the solution! Works great! Great price! Fast delivery!
","
Great easy to use product, since I work at home I mostly keep the charger on my desk making it convenient but my iPhone charges really fast on it. I also like how the lights turn growhen fully charged.
","
very light, and small...works out of the box and even I couldn't screw it up. Wish there was a longer (corded) cable, but that's an easy find. No complaints so far after a few hours of use.
","
It works !! It has some weight to the charger, which speaks quality to me and it has a nice design.  Does what I need it to do.
","
It is slow to charge and isn't easy to place your phone exactly where it should be.
","
I wasn’t too sure when I ordered this but I was pleasantly surprised! It charges my earbuds super fast and is so slim I can put just about anywhere.
","
I love how easy this is to use
","
Love this product. Finally, no more power cords to wear out. I use this wireless charger for my Samsung S20 FE phone. Quickly and easily charges my phone through my phone case.
","
don't like this: the green light always ON.
","
Very good charges slow works on many things
","
Very nice and sleek design and charges my S9 pretty quickly considering it's not a samsung fast charger. looks very nice in my living room.  My 2nd wireless charger
","
This is the first Qi charger I've ever used so I have nothing to compare it with but so far it works very well. The lights are super cool and not at all distracting when I'm trying to sleep. Overall the unit is very sleek and stylish and works well, I'm thinking of getting another one for my desk at work.
","
It charges a little slow but over night is perfect so I don't snatch cord out in the middle of the night or trying to snooze my first alarm. Great for travel
","
Simply put, I love this charger. I have an iPhone XR and to be able to simply lay my phone down at night to charge and not have to mess with plugging it in lol. It also has a more expensive look to it which I appreciate for the price.
","
Great product!
","
Sleek design. Works well. I'm using it to charge my earbuds. My phone is in a bandolier crossbody case and I think no wireless charger will make it thru the credit card pocket on the back.
","
I love the way this looks matches very well with my space gray iPhone XS Max. I’m very happy with my purchase. Seems do charge well I keep it by my bedside to charge my phone and it’s charged by morning time don’t know how the speed is being that I don’t check it over night
","
Very satisfied with the purchase. Works great with my iPhone XR. Doesnt need to be perfectly aligned. The charging indicator light is very helpful, although i feel the colors have been reversed i.e. it should turn green when charging rather than not charging. Beyond the performance the product is aesthetically pleasing and does not look out of place.
","
I've been using this with a Samsung Galaxy 7 in an Otter Defender case, and it is powered by a Pofesun Quick Charger 3.0.  With or without the case, it has only ever changed at the standard rate, not the quick charge rate.  But even with the slow charging rate it is convenient to not dealing with charging cords.For the first 9 months it always established a good connection and charged my phone.Recently it has become unreliable.  The phone reacts like it is being charged, but the plates LED lights are blinking blue.  I can usually fix it by unplugging it for a while and then plugging it back in.Based on the reliability I would not purchase this charger again.2021-04-17 The problem has progressed to the point where it quickly goes to the blue blinking mode (not charging) and has to be unplugged multiple times before it will start working again.
","
I love this thing! Its super convenient to be able to just throw your phone on for a charge. Plus, it looks great and matches the style of my decor. Cant recommend this enough!
","
Product was great when I first started using it but then would randomly stop charging my phone. I looked at other reviews and saw the same thing so I just issued a refund and will try a different brand.
","
I absolutetly love the overall aesthetic and design of the charger which is what sold me on the product. I have limited use with it so far so I'm not sure about the quality of the charging yet, but it looks great on the desk while doing it so I can't complain!
","
Sleek design, great customer service. I ordered two and one was flashing while charging with a slightly different color and faster pace. So they're sending another unit right away. Great experience thus far.
","
Very compact, easy to travel with; very attractive appearance and it worked on my iPhone 12 Max Pro with an Otterbox Defender when the wireless charger (of a different brand) I had would not work.
","
Super easy to use, all you need to do is plug it in and set your phone on it to charge. My phone case does not affect charging. It also looks really nice with the rest of my home decor.
","
As a college student on the go, this is fantastic! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking, and wish this was the first one I had purchased! The price was amazing. Only issue was lack of instructions.
","
Works as advertised, purchased an additional charging block for faster charging. Only problem is the constant green glow it puts off 24/7 it should dim or turn off when not in use.
","
Small convenient charger for tozo earpods! This company always makes quality items . iPhone takes longer to charge on here so I prefer cables but it is great when in a pinch!
","
This charger detects my phone as soon as I place my phone or airpods on the pad, while other chargers is very difficult to make sure your device is correctly placed and is charging
","
Super lightweight and sleek
","
Good but could be better
","
Half the time I put my phone one this charger it will say that it's charging, but the battery percentage will go down
","
Great product for an even greater price. Works perfectly; easy to use right out of the box. Accurately displays battery power and easy to carry for travel and instant charging.
","
I am happy with the charger so far. It's thin and compact. Easy to set up and use. The design is sleek and looks good on my desk.
","
I really like this product! I love this company as well! The light during the night is pretty faint but I would disconnect it if you have a problem with lights. It’s very thing and very portable, which I love. It comes with the USB cable, but not box. I recommend using the Apple iPad box (if you have it).
","
Bought this for the look of it and absolutely love it. My husband requested we put it in the kitchen so he can enjoy it too, ha! Really like it, very easy to use but the charge is slow. That’s to be expected with a charging pad. Would be perfect for overnight use.
","
This is nice and thin but the charge target spot is small and the time it takes to charge is borderline annoying so I use it to only charge at night. I have a mophie from the Apple store that is twice as thick as this but twice as fast charging and 3x more money.  You get what you pay for.
","
Perfect for different areas of the house to charge your phone, which is what I needed it for. And as a bonus I have a charger for traveling.
","
Works really well on the Tozo12 bluetooth earbuds and also on the older Tozo10 bluetooth earbuds
","
Works well and as advertised. USB-C is a must have on any new tech.One thing to consider is that the light loop around the outside of the charger is constantly illuminated- I have it on my desk, but I wouldn’t want it by my bed, as the light would irritate me at night.
","
I’m so excited to see how this goes. Sleek and modern. Easy to know if it’s charging and by far, this seems to be far superior.
","
I really like how the charger is able to charge my phone with my popsocket on. In addition, it can charge phones with thicker  cases. Overall, very nice and don’t have any significant issues.
","
Like the color work very well
","
I bought it for my wife in rose gold, she really loved the design. It’s a really nice wireless charger she can keep on her night stand. It’s works so good, I’ll definitely be ordering one for myself.
","
I just received the TOZO W6 Wireless Charger and it has worked great.  I am able to charge my Iphone with ease and I like not having to plug it in to a cord.
","
Just got the Tozo wireless charger in yesterday. Connected it to my 3.0 wall charger and it works like a champ. It’s literally thin enough to carry in your pocket when on the go. Will work perfect for travel. I’m glad I decided to finally order this charger.
","
My husband loves this product because it saves him time. He can just set his phone down on this at the end of the day and when he picks it up again, it is charged!
","
Love this charger for my phone and earbuds. I’m buying 3 more for gifts and maybe even more after having mine for 2 months no problems.
","
I love the sleek design and minimal space it takes up!! it also lights up so you know its charging and could literally slip into a purse or bag to travel its sooo easy! Got it in gold and love it!
","
Decent for the price. Isn’t a fast charger but works well.
","
It charges super slow. 20 minutes will past and your phone may be only 2% more charged than it was. I would not purchase. The only reason I don’t return the charger is because I don’t like the hassle of returns. Do yourself a favor and just don’t buy it. The high rating deceived me for sure.
","
The only downside, there is no wall adapter included!
","
I have used the product for about 2 days and agreed with other reviewers that the product is aesthetically pleasing with it's sleek design. However, I often find the charging going on an off with my iphone 11 pro max. I often have to move my phone to make sure it's placed properly for the charging to work just to find out it may go off and I would need to reshift the phone. Additionally, it takes 4 hours to charge 50% of the battery, which makes it functionally useless compared to a regular charger which completes full charge in a shorter time.
","
We love it. we have trouble with the wired charger and we loved the wireless charger we bought. it charge fast! i recommend this one and you can't beat the price.
","
This charger is very slim and I love the LED feature in the dark. It charged my phone fast and I am definitely going to buy another one.
","
The perfect wireless charging and super slim.  Fits just about any where.  Charges my Tozo earphones and phone with out the hassle of of all them different cables.
","
I thought I'd only use it for my earbuds, but then my phone charging port got wet and said I couldn't charge it by plugging it in. I remembered this worked, and have used it since. I'm not sure if the charging power is comparable, it may be a little less, but still worth the convenience.
","
This charger works well and is easy for grab and go! No more pulling the charge plug out of my otter box and struggling to put the charger in at night.
","
I love this item! Fast charging
","
This charging pad works great. It has a green LED light that turns blue when charging. It’s very sleek and made of aluminum with rubber feet on the bottom to keep it from sliding. Charges my iPhone XS Max quickly.
","
Very very very slow to charge. In addition, you have to position the phone in one specific spot on order to charge, which makes it hard just to “drop and go”. You have to keep moving it around to find the spot. If my husband had not thrown the packaging away (bad habit!) I would definitely return it. It is a shame because it is very slim and color us great. I have their wireless earbuds and assume it would be equally good, however this charger was a waste of money.
","
Charges your phone but you see those sutle round neon lights in the pictures?  The are anything but sutle in real life. It's like sleeping next to a neon sighn.
","
Best charger I could have bought. It’s elegant, thin, and charges quick! It doesn’t include a plug only the cable but that’s okay because I have the plug from my last charger.
","
Not a cheap looking product looks good sitting on furniture. Lights on base turn blue when charging and green when not or charged. Charges through the wife's S7 phone case which is one of those thick wallet cases. Will buy again.
","
Not quite sure about charging power because I leave it overnight and its fully charged in the morning. I like the overall design and it is very easy tobuse.
","
Does charge fast at all and phone will slip off of it and stop charging. Also it cracked even though it sits on my desk only. Looks nice but it kinda sucks
","
Takes awhile to charge my phone but works great for the price!
","
The product is so good for the price. It charges perfectly. It takes up little space. The led lights are not bright enough to disturb sleep but light up enough to know if your device is charging or fully charged. I would definitely order again!
","
not enough power to work well
","
Glad I purchased it ! Looks as good as it functions , 100% !! I did a lot of research to decide on this one I’m glad I did !! Fits anywhere ! The charging kicks right in !!
","
Super slim and easy to use. I like the use of type-c or micro usb because all my devices are using the one standard and this doesn't mess that up. Great product.
","
This is our first wireless charger. Works great with our two iPhone 11s and AirPod Pros. Looks very sleek. Planning to purchase some more TOZO products soon.
","
Great product. Lights up green when plugged in and turns blue to let you know it is charging something.
","
This charger is everything that I was looking for! It has a unique and slim design that looks beautiful on my night stand, and rivals the apple charger in charging speed. It also has the capability to charge through my pop socket. It comes with a full 1 year warranty, and excellent customer service. I’d 100% purchase from this company again.
","
Works great and the rise good is a pretty touch! Slim design so it’s great on vacation. I can charge my phone on it or my earbuds. Great especially with the awesome price!
","
Nice, well made charger.  Uses a USB C cable and it is included.  Charged my Note 9 and did not get hot.  Also very slim so it will be great for travel.
","
Not satisfied with this product. It doesn't charge my S21 ultra with fast charging. Just regular slow charge
","
This is a beautiful and efficient charger. We seldom use the regular cord charger since we bought these wireless units. We bought several of them to have them accessible around the house.
","
I was reluctant to purchase this but am very pleased with its performance. I've had it for a few weeks now. I use it at my desk at work. It's a great substitute to always plugging in your phone. It's not as fast as a cable but still pretty quick. I recommend this charger and would purchase it again.
","
easy to use
","
I have had mine for about two weeks. It works perfectly.
","
Um it's cute but it has definitely hurt my pixel 5 in the long run. My phone needs to be charged more frequently during the day... My phone is not not even 2 months old.
","
This it’s such a great wireless charger I love it and especially the indicators that show the charging status it just looks so fashion forward I 100% recommend getting this product!
","
Love this product.  Got it for my wife with the ear buds and she loves both products!!  Better than more expensive ones she has had in the past.
","
Nice for the price
","
I like the sleek look of the charger.  You just plug it in and it works immediately.  It also charges quickly. I use it with an iphone.
","
I brought this charger to go with the Tozo T12 ear phones. Both items were given as a gift
","
I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 in a case that I charge using this.  Set up is super easy.  charging is quick.  It is a bit fickle with how the phone is on it, but lights change color to show you when it is charging so just moving the phone a bit solves the issue.
","
I was impressed by the price and design. Seems to work well.
","
I got it for a broken usb port. My cell ph is a Blu brand but it doesn'tcharge wirelessly apparently.  So upsetting. I think I asked and someone gaveme hope. I am sad my phone is perfect except that one issue andI wanted this to work. With rona world I don't know where to fix my usb jack.Thouggt to do it myself. ugh
","
Pros: looks nice and sleek, easy to travelCons: slow charge
","
I purchased this a few months ago and it stopped working. When I plug it in, the lights are on and my phone starts charging then about 15 min and then just shuts off completely and doesn’t change my phone.
","

 I needed a wireless charger because my phone doesnt work with a cord anymore and this is working perfectly for me, love how slim it is. No issues with it at all.
","
I am so impressed with how sleek this charger is. It works great and it is so much better looking than any other wireless charger I've had before. Definitely pleased with this purchase.
","
Very easy to use, unpack, plug in and charge!! It's thin and lightweight, will be great for travel. I bought it for my TOZO wireless earphones, but can also use it to charge my phone and watch! Awesome!!
","
This was an amazing first ever wireless charger.  It was easy to pack up for travel and decent charging time and extremely easy to use.  Highly recommend
","
A friend had this wireless charger and my husband just had to have one for himself.  Super easy to use and now he doesn't have to fumble trying to plug the micro USB into it.
","
I like this wireless charger but 1 downfall is the charging speed. I put my iPhone on the charger for about 20 minutes and It only went up 5%. Everything else is good.
","
I like the look a lot and we wanted it to look good, not bulky. It’s sleek and looks great. The one problem is the chord. It’s white and that’s not a good look next to the gray charger. Also the chord is very short so it does not make it to the wall from the nightstand.
","
It’s smaller than I thought. Was hoping to charge phone & headphones at the same time. Also did know that I’d have to take my case off since it has a ring pop socket.
","
I have not used this charger yet but feel safer using this while sleeping. I am at 75% battery life on my iPhone and started dropping calls last half year.. this charger will be used often!
","
This charger looks so nice, much better quality than I expected and works well with my case and even my pop socket on! Great stuff
","
My phone is in a pretty thick OtterBox and this charger still charges my phone. Nice!
","
What a beautifully made aesthetic looking charger. My first wireless charger and it works amazing! It is very thin and easy to use. Just plug it in and it's charging. This is my 1st choice for a wireless charger for my Android and for the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds. And a very good price indeed. Highly recommend.
","
This item is very easy to operate. Just plug it in to a usb charger and place your Tozo earbud case on top. That’s it! Charges fast!
","
After using for a couple weeks this product has put me off wireless charging completely. It was an impulse buy and I don't know much about wireless. But the final straw was leaving it to charge my phone over night and waking up to 13% battery. Using a normal speed charger plugged in for ten min I can usually get an added 10% charge but with this I'm lucky to see ANY.Maybe I got a defective. But none of the reviews are from after using it for long, so idk. Now I'll go get a cord to ACTUALLY charge my phone.
","
I returned this item because it was not a fast charger like described. When I would first plug into phone it would say fast charging then switch to charging.
","
This wireless charger is okay. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone that is on a go or is in a rush because this chargers very slow. But other than that, I use it all the time.
","
Works with iPhone XS, SE, and Airpods 2 (although those didn't work at first - it just blinked - now it's fine). These look so nice in the living room, and they're great to have for guests. Very happy with the purchase!
","
Decent so far
","
This was great when I first got it but now that it’s 1 month past the time that I’m able to do a return it has stopped charging all together. Thought it was my phone case so I removed it , it’s illuminated green but no matter which way I place my phone it won’t change to blue (blue means it’s charging). Very disappointed, glad I didn’t spend much money on it.
","
This is not compatible with older versions of iPhone, I love it and it works for my phone which is the iPhone XS Max.
","
Charge my iPhone quickly, I’m using this charger instead of my iPhone charger! I really appreciate just laying my phone on the charger! Great job with this product.
","
My personal opinion is that this charger, useful in every respect, except for excellent work, has a VERY COOL DESIGN! Used high-quality materials, it fits perfectly into the interior! The price is absolutely consistent with workmanship and reliability, packaging meets an excellent standard. I chose a charger for a long time, and did not find anything better!
","
This looks very sleek on my desktop.My only concern is that it does not charge my phone very quickly.Would purchase again.
","
This is a great charger! It charges very fast, and is very sleek. And fits well at my desk. I bought a few more for friends and co-workers.
","
I wanted an affordable wireless charger that works: pretty simple. I love this one. I use it to charge my iPhone XS Max and my TOZO wireless earbuds in the case. I love it. I have traveled with is as well; I just wrapped it in some clothing to keep it safe. Bottom line: it works. It also looks cool - bonus.
","
This is a really good wireless charger, especially  for the price. The rose gold accent color is very pretty. The charging power is good-- just set your phone on it and go. Quick and easy to use!
","
This charges my earbuds pretty fast. But my phone takes four to six hours to charge.
","
Won't charge through my thin fake leather iPhone case
","
I have a iPhone XR it charge my battery fast
","
This charger works good but it's very slow. You have to have your phone placed on it just right. I use it to charge at night. I've woken up to a dead phone because it somehow moved off a little bit. I like that the blue light tells you it's charging.
","
Charges very quick.
","
I purchased the white and rose gold charger. It’s beautiful and works well. So far no issues. I recommend this product. Easy to use at home or take with you while traveling.
","
It takes forever to get a full charge. Ive left my phone on the charge overnight only to wake up to 75%. It’s really easy to use. I had no issue lining my phone up for charging but the power isn’t there. I have a iPhone 12 Pro Max. Maybe that’s why it’s so slow? Idk. I’ll keep it for a living room charger for guests but I’m back to my plug in charger unfortunately.
","
Great product charges fast, good investment!
","
Works as advertised. Even worked w/ the case on my phone.
","
Compact car uses
","
Love these have them all over . Love the look of this one as well as it works great
","
This doesn't seem to charge as fast as I thought it would. It was advertised as fast charging, but I find myself having to use a cord to charge my phone faster.
","
Simple and sleek. Was previously looking at the Pixel stand but realized I didn't need all those features. This fit the bill and works perfectly next to my bed stand. I may get another for the office.
","
Very good product and great for charging but the blue light it displays can get a little annoying and wish there was a way to turn it off with it still charging but it works fine when I’m sleeping. I use it for my AirPods 2 (second generation) and works perfectly. Very good product, 5 stars.
","
Pretty powerful little thing that charges my iPhone Xmax or some call it 10 max.It charges my phones battery through a caseAnother attractive point of this charger is it’s price.I do recommend this to my family members.
","
I bought this for charging my iPhone X which works with the new Otterbox too. Super happy I bought it, great product which also looks nice!
","
I got this as a charging dock for my work desk at home. Matches perfectly with my white and gold accents! It seems to take a while longer to charge than a regular USB charger, but it looks nice and works decent. I do love that it lets you know when it’s charging and when charging is complete.
","
El artículo no es igual al que aparece en el empaque con luces led en la parte de arriba que indican si está cargando.
","
These are so convenient- don’t wait any longer to purchase one! I should have bought them sooner. I bought two and will be buying several more to have them in every room of my house! And the price is right!
","
I'm very picky with chargers. This one is super slim, looks good, works every time, and doesn't cost near what it's worth. Definitely buy it!
","
Inexpensive wireless charger that works great and is slim and not ugly. I use it for my Google pixel4 and iphone 12 and my wireless earphones. Works for most everything it seems.
","
Nice product at half price, no overheating. I wish it charged a bit faster but it does work for my airpods & iphone 12 max pro which is nice. Thanks!
","
I ordered a 3.0 wall adapter to support the fast charging but it doesn't fast charge with my s10 5G, other wireless chargers do fast charge on it though
","
Great charger. Been using it for months by my bed.
","
Doesn’t come with a plug and it charges way to slow . I know many people with different charges that work much better although this shiny charger looks nice iG sucks
","
Good design and performance
","
Doesn’t stay charging... blue charge light turns to flashing green. What does the mean?  Very hard to find the sweet spot where the charger connects to the iPhone battery.
","
I was hesitant at first for the price, but love it and it charges fast. U just have to make sure it's on charger exactly right
","
I love this wireless charger so much that I bought a second one to keep at work. It’s an amazing product at an amazing price. It’s truly a must buy!
","
I can charge my cellphone, a Samsung SPlus 9, and my earbuds and it is so easy to manage it
","
The wireless charger is slim and convenient for both traveling and for around the house use. I like the design, the efficiency, and not having to track down individual cables and connectors.
","
It’s okay I don’t think it’s amazing but if you are working like for college students who love the library this is good and those who want to stay off your phone at night.
","
Too long to charge, very easy to use!
","
Amazing little charger, especially considering the price paid. Led lighting on top is a cool little feature and it is very thin and professional looking. I bought One for work travel and at home!
","
These are very thin and sleek. I love how convenient it is to charge my phone/bluetooth earbuds with this charger, and it’s very flat on my nightstand (which is good!).
","
I’ve only had This product for a few days but so far it meets my expectations of a wireless charger for a fraction of what you would pay in the store. It is sleek looking and charges quickly. What more can you ask for? Time will tell if it lasts, but I would buy it again given the price.
","
it's a really nice, minimalistic design. I'm glad i chose the black color because it almost blends into my desk which looks really cool. 10/10 would recommend c:
","
I've tried two different android phones, an android watch and an iPhone- none get charged. The only thing this charges is the same brand Bluetooth earbuds ...which I can easily charge through an average wire. Even though this wireless charger was on sale for under $13.00... in this economy.. it is not worth it.
","
Definitely was just what I needed. Love the ease of being able to charge my phone without the power cord.
","
Looks very good. I bought the Rose gold for my wife and looks very chic.Build quality is good too. Lights are not that bright but remains on all the time (the blue light while charging is not that intrusive).Just remember to use a power adapter with enough juice ie. iPhone stock adapter wont work.
","
IMO, the best looking wireless charger on the market.  I have a iPhone 11 Pro Max and the clear Spigen case.  It charges perfectly.  It is very light to travel with and the price point is great for what you get. I am a fan and will be purchasing additional ones as gifts for the holidays!
","
I really like how cute it looks and how easy to set it up (although bit difficult to plug in the cable). But it is incredibly slow to get my iphone charged, it took 2 hours to charge about 10%, I was very disappointed. It has no comparison to my original iphone charger, which was plugged into the same usb outlet, charges from 0 to 100% in 2 hours. I made sure I put my phone correctly and it's showing purple all the time.
","
Very appealing to the eye with the slick black look to it. Lights up when in use, charging time can vary from device. Mostly using it for charging my galaxy pods and it gets the job done! I like how it's not bulky and doesn't seem to overheat. Good buy, for a decent price!
","
Best wireless charger ever! Works with phones and my TOZO ear buds. Great price and does what it should. Like that it is not very thick. Easy to pack for traveling.
","
Slim profile, easy to use, charges phone as it should. Does exactly what I want and looks very sleek.Will get more to have around the house for discrete charging
","
Just plug it in and it's ready. Charges my S21 through the case. Nice and slim. No skid bottom leaves less chance of knocking it off the table.
","
Works great! You do have to buy a box to plug it into the wall, it only comes with the charging circle and the usb cord but it charges very fast.
","
First- It functions as described.  It will charge Apple and Android devices.  Including my Airport!  Very convenient!  As others have stated, it isn't too finicky about device placement.
","
I great quality with an awesome price!! Definitely recommend this as a wireless charger! Fast charge and doesn’t get hot like some others I’ve tried. It’s easy set up and easy use for sure!
","
Low profile and minimalistic, cord could've been longer but it worked for me.
","
I was pretty excited about this charger however it takes FOREVER to charge and you have to place your phone just so to get it to charge. Now I have an iPhone but I tried it with my daughters Samsung and had the same issues.
","
Very slim, nice design.  Works well with both my Samsung and Apple phone.
","
Phone must be in the exact spot for it to charge. The lights stay on the charger even when the phone isn’t on the charger
","
Very appealing to the eye! I bought the tozo wireless earbuds which I would recommend to anyone, and the charger has been holding up well! The wireless charger supports fast-charging for my android device.
","
Great wireless charger.  The lights turn blue when your phone is charging - which is so much better than others I have.  Too many times my kids’ phones don’t charge overnight because they can’t easily tell, but I always can.  It’s sleek and thin and looks great.  Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a wireless charger.
","
I love my new wireless charger, I keep it on my desk to keep my phone charges throughout the day.It is very easy to use, I wouldn't want to bring it with me while traveling simply because I wouldn't want to lose or damage it but it is perfect for a desktop, counter top or side table.
","
Very nice charger not looking around for my cord to charge, I leave this by my recliner on a table very convenient.
","
Not only is it slim and extremely elegant for its value, but this charger is also a great alternative to cables that might get twisted, broken, or accidentally ripped out of your phone.
","
Takes a bit longer to charge my phone than I would have expected but does the job well nontheless.
","
This is an amazing wireless charger. I have used several of these types of chargers before and they never seem to charge my phone right unless I position it perfectly. This charger is not only very sleek looking but charges my phone even if it is not perfectly centered.  I highly recommend this charger.
","
I love that the charger has lights on the side that change colors to let you know when it’s actually charging or not so you’re not constantly checking your phone!!
","
This charger is great! I love it. I needed a wireless charger for my desk and got not only that but one I could take with me.
","
Works well and fast
","
Perfect MagSafe charger with animation screen enabled. Works perfectly without any difference between apples official MagSafe charger and this one.Go for this charger with half the price of the official charger!
","
I bought this charger for my tozo earbuds. Right out the box it was an ease to use. It’s green when not charging and blue when the item is charging. Works great for my iPhone too. Great deal for a pad. Only feedback would be to include a wall adapter for the charging cord.
","
Awesome product but a little disappointed they shipped the wrong color. Ordered matte black and they shipped black. Didn’t have time to exchange due to being Christmas gifts but good product and quick shipping
","
love this charger, thin, flat... ring light is blue while charging and turns green when phone is fully charged
","
This wireless charger is pretty good! I've been wanting one and it works on my airpods as well. Very aesthetic and easy to use.
","
I love the sleek look to it. very easy to use all you have to do is plug it in and put the phone on. Great for traveling because of size.
","
Good charger but the cord broke a few days after being used. And the website requires you to create account to order new one.
","
Good, slim, wireless charger. I like that the light changes color as it charges. It charges a little slower than my regular wired charger, but works fine for when I'm at home.
","
It does exactly what it says. It's super thin and with a slick design. I like the little led lights that indicate if the charger is powered on and if it is charging any device. It comes in a nice packaging and I'm surprised for the overall quality considered the cheap price. I recommend this item.
","
I love my new wireless charger for my iPhone 11 and my AirPod Pros. It charges through a Bandolier Phone Case with 3 Credit cards in it!!!!
","
Great little charger. Love the small light so I can use it where I sleep. Very convenient and easy to use. This would be a good travel charger.
","
It's a very well built charger and the light isn't very bright but it isn't fast charging capable with Samsung and takes forever to charge
","
I use the charger mainly for charging my wireless earbuds and my phone. It helps while I am multi-tasking throughout the day. Why didn't I get this sooner!
","
Stopped working
","
I like the bold lights and they change colors while in use depending on if the device is just plugged in, charging, or completely charged. I have the gold color and it is sleek
","
This charger from TOZO is awesome.  Super faster charger that works on my daughter's I phone and ear buds. Highly recommend.
","
I loved this as soon as I opened its big enough for my phone and to put in my bag for on the go. Fast charging !
","
First time with a wireless charger. It’s absolutely magic! The best new purchase for my new phone! Pleasantly surprised with 1 year warranty, and customer service card included.
","
This charger is very reliable and charges your phone very quickly!  I use this as my charger on my night stand and the light is just bright enough For me to see that it is charging.  A must buy!
","
I love this charging pad it's no good for travel but it works excellent even when you have a case on your phone
","
Love the look. Only had it for a month so don't know long term, but so far...perfect
","
Easy to use out of the box with my Samsung Galaxy S7.  Includes USB-C power cord.  Lights up green to let you know it has power, and turns blue when charging.
","
I will be using this product everyday! It is charging my iPhone X plus without any issue. The material is high quality and design is elegant. Very compact. You would need a USB power adapter.
","
Very slim. Large charging area. Guiding lights turn blue when phone is in the right position forn charging and they turn green when phone is charged.
","
Smaller than previous model but real nice charger
","
The W3 is slightly smaller than the W1 and considerably lighter weight, making it very nice for a travel charger.The charging indicator is very small, making it harder to see than the W2 but still adequate.
","
Love this Tozo charger. The look and feel of this product made me feel like it was a really good product.  After using it for about a week, I absolutely love it.
","
Works great with my Tozo earbuds. It works with my Galaxy ultra if I place it on just right.
","
Amazing build quality.  This is the nicest wireless charger I have seen.  Looks and feels like a iPhone build.  Led lights are perfect and not too bright.
","
Easy to setup and use. Charges well, looks good, small and compact. I like not having to plug my phone into a cord anymore.
","
Stopped working right after my window to return had passed. Lights come on and appears to work but is not charging my phone.
","
Awesome product ! Thank You, it works perfectly!!
","
It is a much cheaper feeling plastic than I expected and it is smaller than I thought it would be, but honestly, it fast charges my note 8 well and is night time friendly with low lighting.
","
I am very satisfied with this purchase. I love the sleek thin design and the white one matches the aesthetic of my office and other accessories very well. Also has a very strong charging capacity. Would recommend 10/10.
","
Seems to be doing the job, charging is a bit slower than anticipated.
","
I like the ease but it worries me that it gets hot and what I’m charging.
","
Although it works with my iphone, it does not work with my airpods. I bought this so i could charge both the iphone and the airpods, but it doesn't work. false advertisement.
","
This was a gift for my sister, she absolutely loved it.
","
It charges the phone as advertised. The lights on the base are a nice touch. The only drawback is that you must provide your own power block.
","
I love the packaging & feel of this charger. I literally just got it delivered & opened it up, but haven’t actually used it yet. I look forward to a flawless product!
","
Takes so long to charge my phone. Ive had my phone on it for the past 2 hours and the charge has only gone up 20%. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option.
","
I really like the design but I don't think it is powerful enough. It takes a long time to charge my phone.
","
Works great and really does fast charging.  I did have to take my plastic case off as it wouldn't  charge through the case but other than that it works great!
","
Love it works well next to my chair! That way if someone calls I just pick up the phone instead of unplugging my phone! Great product!
","
I bought this thinking it would be easier to use than a corded charger. It is not. First of all, while other wireless chargers have easily worked though my plastic case, this only works with direct contact from the phone. Second, it isn’t as simple as “place the phone on the charger.” I had to move the phone around to get it to charge- it only works if the phone lays precisely correct. Finally, even when it does make contact, the speed of charging is woefully slow. An hour of charging only resulted in a 5% increase in charge. I am very disappointed by this product, even for the price.
","
It's more convenient than a plugin but not as fast as I thought it would be. I would recommend this product.
","
Charges very fast.
","
Very pleased with this, great value and color matches the wireless ear buds beautifully.  Charges the case and ear buds fast.
","
Charges really fast and is super sleek. Really thin so you can take it anywhere. Great buy!
","
Very easy to use. Connects better than my $50 Samsung. Love it so much I bought in another color.
","
Works great and looks great, bought another to bring into my office, can easily just slide it in my desk at the end of the night
","
The first one I recieved did not work, but I conacted the manufacture and they were very helpful. They sent ne a replacement and I recieved it today and its working great!
","
This is not a 'fast charging' device, charges at normal speed. Takes 3-4 times longer than a real 'fast charger'
","
Purchased this for my wife.I was a little skeptical because it was priced so cheap.I ordered it Friday, and received it Sunday.I opened the box and was surprised by the overall look and feel.It is very thin and solid.THANKS FOR A NICE LITTLE PRODUCT.I would definitely recommend this product.
","
This looks awesome.  Sleek, well made and elegant.  The ""status"" LED strips are so precise and slim, they look very expensive and sophisticated.  Every time I walk by it in the kitchen, I glance at it.  It's just that cool looking.Of course it charges my 8+ just fine, even through a case.
","
Super sleek design, i loved this one the most among all the selection Amazon had. easy to use, works with iphone 8 and any new iphone version beyond that. we put it in the kitchen island area so its for everyone to use, no need to ask for cords! or the hassle of plugging it in!
","
Thin and sleek. Works great on my nightstand
","
Super slim and easy to idea
","
I found this very convent for use in my home.
","
I love the convenience of this charger & the price! It doesn’t charge my phone fast, but it’s convenient to have beside my bed. Charged by morning.
","
Nothing to dislike at all. Love it.
","
The charger was delivered at super speed. I like the sleek design and additional bells and whistles like letting you know the full charge is complete. Totally happy with this purchase.
","
Plug in and ready to go
","
Everything was working well with this product until about a month in. After that point I would wake up and take my phone off of its charging station to find it either dead or at 10-20% battery. At first I thought maybe I had done something wrong; perhaps I had placed the phone slightly off the charging pad. Every night now I have been checking expressly to make sure the phone says it is charging before bed and more often than not I wake up to a phone with such low battery it needs to be plugged in for another hour before I can start my day.
","
convenient to use, inexpensive, the battery lasts a long time, the sound is very good
","
I wanted to charge my phone quickly and easily.  This device delivered exactly what I needed.  It works perfectly and I'm satisfied with the performance.  Highly recommend
","
Light and compact. Very easy to use.
","
One less cord on the nightstand and it looks great! Charges very fast and easily senses the phone when you set it on it. I have had chargers in the past that the phone has to be positioned just right to charge but this is  not the case with this product! Definitely  recommend!
","
The overall product is nice but don’t expect it to charge the device very fast it’s good if you set your phone down a lot while you work, it will NOT charge AirPods  but as far as looks go it’s 5/5
","
Perfect wireless charger! Im tired of constantly buying new phone cords because they start breaking or stop working, so when I found this wireless charger; I knew it was time to get one! It’s sleek and works great! It’s small enough to be portable. You won’t be disappointed!! There’s even a warranty that comes with it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
","
It shipped really fast and works great.Took it out of the box, plugged it in and myphone was charged way faster then I thoughtpossible. I ordered another one last night for my wife.It'll be here today by 6pm...
","
Love this wireless charger. It is super thin, classy looking and charges my phones quickly. Keep it on my nightstand by my bed. The light is so subtle and does not bother me trying to sleep!
","
This is a TRUE wireless charger. I have used previous wireless chargers but you always have to be sure to position the phone in a certain way for it to charge; with this i just place it and forget it.so far so good :)
","
Nice charging pad, seems to be constructed well and looks good.  An indicator on the edge or sound would be nice for charging larger devices but overall I like it.
","
The wireless charger is nice and reliable. It’s small enough to fit in the corner of my nightstand and it looks really nice.
","
I have phone case that includes a holder for 2 credit cards. This charger works with the phone case on. Very nice.
","
Got this a little while ago and forgot to write a review. Very handy and sleek charger, but not a fast charger.
","
Sleek design, easy to use anywhere and good charging speed. Satisfied with this purchase and recommend this to others. I would but couple more for other places in our house. Good product!!
","
I use this to charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 on my bedside table. I love the subtle colored LEDs that help me know exactly where to place it... this is extremely helpful at night. I have not yet been able to confirm if it supports fast wireless charging but since this is for overnight charging I wouldn't miss it.
","
Decent wireless charger. Good for traveling (on the smaller side) Lights on the charger seem a little to bright at night, but it works.
","
This thing is great. It’s my second wireless charger I’ve bought from TOZO. Alas, one was not enough. It is fast charging and way slimmer and lighter than the previous model. TOZO makes great products!
","
Definitely looks great and gets the job done!
","
This wireless charger looks sleek. It is very slim, compact, easy to take anywhere. And it works very well. I am glad that it comes with USB-C port.
","
So far everything works great. The quality of the product is nice very sleek light weight.  Very fast charge and easy to use.
","
It's easy to use it just takes around double the time than a wall charger which makes it more inconvenient! Would work well for charging phone overnight on a nightstand though
","
It stopped working after 2 weeks and i dont know how to fix it
","
Sleek & perfect for charging phone w/ low profile. Easy to use, perfect gift for my tech loving husband. He liked it so much he ordered one for his office.
","
I love this charger it is extremely thin and feels very nice but the two LED strip lights do not shut off ever so they are extremely annoying at night.
","
I'm sure it isn't as fast as the plug in lightning charging cable, but for the sheer convenience factor it is worth it. Works great with a 20w Apple wall plug.
","
This charger is very thin and easy to unpack. You will need a plug for it. Phone fits nicely and lights go from green to blue while charging.
","
Almost impossible to ensure phone will charge...getting phone in proper position is difficult.  If you get a call or text while charging, phone will move out of alignment and thus it won’t charge.
","
This charger is a beauty with fancy lights. It charges slowly using a USB port on a laptop and it looks great.
","
One year later and it's still working! Need I say more....
","
So far so good - much easier to get the phone in the right spot. Looks nice too, love how thin it is and that it matches my phone’s gold trim.
","
I've used quite a few chargers from other companies and these are by far the most functional and beautiful I've ever owned. So far I have charged multiple phones and other Qi-compatible devices without any problems, even through cases. They're larger than most, and the glass design just looks fantastic. Can't go wrong.
","
I use it to charge my cell phone
","
Love this product. Thin design is great. This product works better than the one I bought from my local mobile store.
","
Does the job for a great price. I have not experienced any issues. It does not charge an apple watch though.
","
Beautiful Charger. Slim and doesn’t take up very much space. I sit at a desk all day with my phone on the charger and also have a Magic Mouse that I added Qi charging to that works beautifully with this device.
","
Just received my charger.  It work to charge my iPhone as well as the earbuds I purchased with it. Still a new product so at this point I’m satisfied.
","
easy to use definitely am going to buy another one because one just isn’t enough my friends and family can’t stop using so glad i got it
","
The ease of use!  No more fumbling in the dark to try and find charging port to plug in to!  Simply amazing!
","
Love it! Has a small tiny dot of light which hasn’t bothered my sleep at all and I need a pitch dark room to sleep properly. Charges easily, no need to fidget around with the phone positioning. Love it! Glad I bought it.
","
This charger was a recommendation from our company IT department for our new iPhone XRs.  I liked how convenient and affordable it was.  Being able to put it in a small corner of my desk is great.  I have not used it for travel but it would be very easy to do so.
","
I like that it gives an indicator for when the charger is active (green for standby and blue when charging). It is very light weight and I can move it around with ease. It doesn't take up much space and it definitely charges the wireless headphones quickly.
","
Lo compre para cargar mi blth❤️❤️
","
I ordered this charger because it says it charges through a thin phone case.  It doesn't.  The phone connect to the charger,  the charger recognized the phone but that's about it.  No charge.  I left my phone on this charger all night (battery at 32%) and in the morning my battery was at 1%.My case is a UAG, thin,  no metal and made for wireless charging.Also the charger doesn't come with a plug, just the USB cable.
","
I go to bed hours after my wife and its so nice to not have to fumble around for a charger in the dark. Easy set up and I was on my way to ""setting and forgetting""
","
Arrived quickly , works fine
","
The look is very nice. Has grips on bottom to keep from sliding. I dont have the ac adapter and it seems to still charge great! I plan on buying more of these.
","
I just got this today, but I love it! I just lay my phone or new earbuds on it, and it starts charging automatically. I wish that I’d gotten one sooner!
","
I really like this products sleek design.  It is also super thin so I could just throw it in my purse and not worry about my phone battery!  It’s also super fast!  I was shocked!
","
The charging power is great! It is also really sleek looking and I love the color selection. It is a very affordable option and functional!
","
Does what it is supposed to do. Can't think of any issues. I have a purposefully, extra thick case on my Pixel 5, and no issues with that.
","
Super easy to use and charges phone fast!
","
Product was as advertised and arrived a little ahead of schedule
","
Easy set up and great style love it
","
very impressed with quality of product. also how slim it is and sleek looking. the charging cord is not super long on it, but workable.
","
Bought one in black and one in white (rose gold).... bought them a while ago, maybe a month ago and they work great. I was sick of breaking all the wired cords and so far I think this is the replacement.
","
don’t buy this unless you want toCatch your nightstand or carpet on fire…
","
Would order it again
","
I was surprised that it even charged iPhones, given the fact that it's almost impossible to find anything compatible with their products. It is fantastic!!!! Happy I purchased it given it was recommended.
","
Great design and very easy to use. I wasn’t sure if the case adapter I bought for my iPhone 7 Plus would work with the charging pad but it works beautifully. I definitely recommend this if you want wireless charging capability.
","
I bought two of these and my wife and I both have Samsung S22 Ultra's and these won't reliably charge either phone. Sometimes you will wake up with a fully charged phone but about half of the time you will wake up and the charger will have stopped charging and you now have a dead phone.
","
Was excited to try this, but doesn’t charge very fast. It’s okay. You get what you pay for.
","
It’s not like plugged in, worth the price.  I’ve noticed it needs a power reboot occasionally but it’s not bothersome to me
","
This is beautiful charger that charges my iPhone very fast. The face of it lights up, but I just place my phone sideways to cover the light.
","
Did not work with or without the case on the phone. I tinkered around with it until I was annoyed. Should not have to do that. Back it goes.
","
I like that I can charge my tozo ear buds quickly and my phone on this charger. now we can take one charger instead of multiple chargers when we go somewhere.
","
Such a simple idea and it charges super fast!
","
Very easy to use, and charges quickly.  It would be nice if it were a bit smaller in diameter, but is a minor issue.
","
First off, no complaints. It's very very thin, yet seems very solid. Nothing about this feels cheap. I've tested this out against a similar charger made by Verizon, and Tozo's charger is far better in finding the battery, looks far better, and feels high end. It also charges a bit faster. You can't really lose here.
","
Works as it should. Great for bedside because it gives off minimal light compared to other units.  It's thin and stable.
","
I really like this charging pad, it’s so stylist and it actually charges fast. I tested it with my friends Samsung phone and my iPhone and it actually does work.
","
Build quality is solid and looks great. Functionally it’s not practical because devices slide easily off the slippery charging surface. It also stops charging my iPhones after a while and I have to shift the phone for it to charge again.
","
Does what it’s meant to do.Cool little gadget
","
So sleek and looks beautiful on my nightstand. Doesn’t charge as fast as my iPhone charger but I don’t normally need to fast charge option anyways.
","
Love it!! Best low cost purchase I’ve made for electronics! I was skeptical about it but it’s a nice sleek looking charger!
","
Very slim and connects to the phone easily! Just received it, but appears to charge pretty quickly with the recommended 15W power brick for the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
","
Absolutely a great charger it works through the cases my husband purchased one prior to me and his doesn’t charge his cell at all.
","
It's okay but if you don't position your phone just write on it it won't charge your phone and it's kind of slow
","
This charger works perfectly with my iPhone 10 and also my earbuds.  Phone does get warm on the charger, however.
","
I love this item!  I currently have a charging station that I plug my phone into and this plugs into that station. I catch myself using the this item more than my station because it is so reliable and charges my phone very fast. I don’t have to worry about making sure my phone gets plugged in correctly.
","
Super easy to use. This product is a no brainer. Plug it into the wall and lay your phone on top. Small portable.
","
I am very disappointed with this product. I put my phone on the charger and went to sleep. When I woke up, my phone was completely dead. I thought I made a mistake so I checked that all the plugs were secure and that the charging icon was lit up. I left my phone there for several hours and it barely charged. I tried one more time that night and same thing happened, no charge, phone was nearly dead. Piece of junk. I would not recommend.
","
Love this charger. Easy to use and I don't have to take my phone case off to charge my phone! Such a great price
","
I really like this product. It’s easy to use. very convenient and I can bring it a lot of places. It doesn’t charge very fast but it helps keep dirt and dust out from the charging hole in my phone and so it doesn’t ware down.
","
Pretty good charger, but touchy so be careful not to move it when alarms set at night or you will be late for work!
","
I appreciate the sleekness and simplistic design of the charger. It’s a pretty straight forward design, so it’s easy to use for anyone.
","
Easy to see charging ( blue light) while phone is sitting on the unit. Easy to place phone on to get it in position for charging
","
Works great my wife loves it charges her I phone fast
","
Looks great aesthetically. Takes a while to charge your phone, though.
","
Not too much I can say about this charger, other than it charges as well as any similar device I have, looks cool (champagne-colored) in my opinion.
","
Worked really well with the LG V40 the iphone and the Todo ear plugs. Sadly the new OnePlus 8T does not have that charging capability.
","
I bought two--black with silver rim and white with silver rim.  Both work fine.  Happy with the charging speed. The indicator lights glow green when not charging and blue when charging.  If you keep it at your bedside and want darkness, just rotate your phone so it blocks the lights.
","
I Love My New Wireless Chargers They Are So Easy To Use And Save The Charge Port On My Phone From Wear And Tear.
","
It charges a little slow.
","
Love the ease of this charger! It does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Super lightweight and thin. You must buy this product!
","
Super easy to install, it is also very pretty and my coworkers have been asking me where I got it! But most importantly I am able to charge my phone with the case on!
","
Love my wireless charger. So pretty, classy and I love the rose gold. Super easy to use and I love not having to plug my phone in!
","
Got two of these chargers to charge wireless headphone on for virtual school use. They work great and are super simple to use and set up. They also charge our iPhones easily.  Highly recommend!
","
I ordered another one in a square shape from another vendor and I have to say the biggest difference I like is the blue/green light on this one that shows you are good to go or if you need to move your phone around a little. Great value. Hopefully will hold up over time.
","
The product is slim and looks expensive, but there is a double green light that never goes off, which could be annoying at night. You must line it up pretty accurately in order to get the charge, but other than that I like it. I would not have ordered it had I known the light never goes off
","
The product seems to be made out of quality materials and durable. Very simple to use, where others you have to find the “sweet spot” to get the phone to charge.
","
Very sleek design and light weight. So far so good! Only wish it came with soft carrying case to prevent scratching when you have to put in your purse or work bag.
","
Funciona muy bien
","
Very nice looking and slim product.  My only criticism would be that the charging light does not change color with my iPhone to indicate the charge is complete.
","
Easy use. Led indicators to show charging status. You have to supply your own ACadapter.
","
I actually like that it doesn't take up much room, I can also use it without removing my phone case. Great charging power and very easy to use. I also charge my earbuds with it.
","
Love the way this charger looks it is so sleek and nice! Only thing is it makes that high pitched screech noise that chargers make sometimes. It usually only makes it when it is not currently charging something. This started after a few weeks after owning it.
","
The Tozo wireless charger is great! The build quality is nice and is super slim for taking it on the go. It plugs in via usb-a to usb-c (usb-c on the charger itself. Would buy again!
","
Works great and it’s not too big. I wouldn’t mind a little travel case or baggie for it but all in all it’s a great product so far and serves its purpose.
","
It definitely is easy to use and transport but it charges EXTREMELY slow. I bought it for my desk and it charges maybe like 2% every 10 minutes
","
The only thing I didn’t like was that as long as it’s plugged in the light stays on. It does charge with a pop socket but it’s a little finicky.
","
I'm incredibly impressed with this little wireless charger. They've got a very premium look and build. I will be buying several more for various rooms in the house. You can't go wrong with these for 12 bucks.
","
Amazing charger my daughter loves it.And it very Modern.
","
This has been a great way to charge my iPhone SE and my Tozo T12 ear buds. Super easy to use and the charging power has been good.
","
Bought four of these to have around the house and we love them! They’re a great tool to be able to set your phone down for a little while. Plus they charge fast!
","
I dislike it has low charging power
","
So far I found this charging base to be multi usable for several products. Very easy to store and travel with. I would buy it again.R Landis
","
was able to successfully replace 4 power adaptors with this one wireless high-speed device.  Even charges faster than the high-speed chargers that came with all of my Samsung items.
","
This wireless charger is a game changer. It’s easy to use and so modern and clean. It really upgraded my night stand. I feel extra fancy with it.
","
Works great and charges my earbuds fast
","
This little charger is a super strong!! It chargers right through my case! I’ve never found a wireless charger be able to do that. This charger is cute and looks great!!
","
I use it to charge my tozo ear pogs. But I wish I could also charge my Samsung watch that waa a bummer
","
Wanted my first wireless charger and saw the prices Apple was charging, thought I would look into others and found this.  So far so good and what a great price!
","
This wireless charger is really nice. It matches the aesthetics of my macbook pro and desk layout overall.  It charges without issues.  I got it for my airpod pros and works flawlessly.  This should be a standard.  Clean as it gets.
","
I really like the rose gold design and that it has grips at the bottom. Sleek lightweight.
","
Works correctly with iPhone 12, unlike some other brands. The charging animation comes up and it changes correctly unlike the one that got returned
","
It works really well and just the model/design is beautiful. You can leave this sitting around your house and it will not look like an annoying badly made wireless charger. Also, the price is great. You do not pay much and you get a superb product. Definitely recommend
","
Wireless works great. Another really cool thing is that its compatible with pretty much everything except for older phone models. Tozo's wireless earphones are also really great.
","
It's sleek and pretty, but just doesn't work well. Turns off and on randomly and just IS NOT RELIABLE. I wake up some mornings with no battery and I don't know what's wrong with it. Sometimes I put my phone on there and it just flashes between blue and green without charging. SO FRUSTRATED! I was really excited to receive this because I love the ease of a wireless charger, but this product was just disappointing.
","
Great product!
","
Quality product
","
It's a very modern design. One note is that it uses USB-C. Be aware if you want to buy a longer cable than the included cable.
","
It would be hard to use this in the car because the phone may slide off the charging pad. Otherwise I absolutely love it
","
This charger really works for different phones! I used it and it immediately charged my phone. Super fast, super efficient and small so you can travel with this and charge your phone in a hurry
","
I love how easy to use without connecting the phone to a cable. The LED color changing helps to ensure the phone is positioned properly to charge.
","
I have another brand of wireless charger and it takes forever! TAZO charges three times faster! Well worth the purchase price!
","
Can't get it to work
","
I got this to charge my IPhone 11. It seems to work the way it should and it has a pretty sleek look to it.
","
So much easier to charge different devices!💕
","
I am very satisfied with my purchase. The charging pad is made well, sturdy, and very stylish. It looks great on my desk and charges my phone while I am working. Great product at this price point.
","
The charger stopped working a few weeks after I bought it. The warranty process was simple and quick. My new replacement charger arrived quickly and seems to be working great.
","
Muy buen cargador, efectivo ya compré otro 👍👍👍
","
The OZO W1 Wireless Charger works great with my tozo wireless earbuds. It charges very quickly and is easy to bring to go, though I don't have to very often, the charge holds for at least two days on my wireless earbuds. I've had it only about one month, but loving it so far.
","
Extremely easy to use and set up! I recommend this
","
Lovely thin wireless charger! Surprised over how thin and portable this is. Able to charge all kinds of devices compatible with the Qi protocol.
","
I love not having to worry about my cord cutting out! Works great and charges quickly. I don't know why it took me so long to try a wireless charger but I'm glad I finally did!
","
Working great
","
I ordered two of these wireless chargers. They are super sleek and stylish. I love the aesthetic and beautiful design! They do come with a cord just no box but that’s fine because we a ton laying around at home. They’re easy to use and provide a quick charge!
","
Amazing, just have to buy the right base to power it!
","
Well made and works as described. USB A to C adaptor is helpful. Magnet is Stong. Slightly greater diameter than Apple product so does not work in additional stand.
","
Very compact, easy to place in a convenient location that does not clutter its surroundings. Purchased to charge my earbuds, recommended by numerous other Amazon Customer reviews.
","
Me agrado todo del producto.
","
Bought 2. One wont charge my wifes iphone, but the other will.... idk why. Black one does both, white one only does our android. Boxes were different also.
","
The device couldn't be simpler.  No setup to speak of, just plug it in and it does what it's supposed to do.  Wireless fast charges my Note9 like a champ.
","
only suggestion for improvement is a higher quality cord.  Right now the cord is kind of cheap and ""kinky"" and seems rather hard to hide.
","
Excellent , sleek , and amazing . I tried this with a nominal qc3.0 and the charging speed is amazing . No issue of any heat that is typically associated with wireless charging ! The LED change color indicating if the charging process and couldn’t ask for more ! Great buy .
","
Like the overall concept but in customer reviews and pics it shows 2 half ring ( blue or green ) lights. Mine does not have any lights on top of plate.
","
This is great charger.  The lights indicating standby and charging are very useful, and it does a great job charging my phone.  After my initial purchase, I got a second one so that I could have one in my office and at home.
","
Got this for my daughter's Iphone 8Plus. She then got an iphone 12 and it works well with that too. Clean looks. Comfortable size. Easy to carry when traveling. Definitely would recommend.
","
Wonderful charger. Charges my phone on a decent amount of time. Love the color and how slick and fashionable it looks. I would recommend these as a stocking stuffer for friends and family.
","
Very easy to use.
","
Excellent product my charging port wasn’t working and now this makes itTo where I don’t have to purchase a new phone will be ordering another for my spouse
","
This wireless charger looks great it has a very elegant and thin design that matches more recent cellphones. It charges very well and I would recommend it for use with Tozo earbuds or any other device.
","
I bought two - one for the office and one for my home.  I love the design, and it is so easy to drop it quickly coming in and leaving the room.  The colors are a nice touch to let you know it’s charging.  Sleek and fast-charging for a good price.  I recommend.
","
This charger takes forever to charge any device. Waste of money do not buy
","
This works perfectly I used it everyday and absolutely had no problems with it whatsoever.
","
Super easy and less than half the cost of one from the phone store. I've had it for 3 most and works great!
","
l really like that the color changes when it is charging. Set it up. Place phone on it when you need a charge. No more fiddling with cables.
","
The product looked great and was relatively easy to set up. However, after. more than 8 hours of charging my phone had only increased by 20%. My phone has a great battery and charges very quickly with every other charger but with this one, it took forever. I bought two of them and my mom had the exact same experience with her phone. I don't understand why it has such great reviews because the charging power is awful. This is just not worth your money unless you are only looking for something that looks nice.
","
Chargers through my otter box case. Can’t ask for more.  Have 2 of them. One for home and one for the office.
","
I’ve had this for a little over a month. It charges good for the most part but I had a few incidents where it doesn’t charge my phone. It just heats it up. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and I don’t have that problem with the original charger.
","
Nice looking and easy but isn’t reliable. Wouldn’t keep this around without a backup
","
Bought this as a suggestion.  Works great for both the ear buds and the phone.  Quality made, and great packaging.  The ear buds by the way are the only buds I've found that are wireless charge for the price point that does not require another type of charge cord to drag around.
","
Which is really cool. It fits perfectly in the corner of my nightstand and I can just set my phone down after a long day.
","
I bought this after being tired of always buying the cable chargers and it matches the aesthetic in my bedroom! Super easy to set up but no plug in comes with it. Overall great product and definitely going to recommend it.
","
Charge phones slow only good for ear phones
","
This wireless charger is simply awesome! It's small, sleek, beautifully designed and works unbelievably well and fast! We took it out of the box and immediately started using it. To our surprise it charged our phones incredibly fast in a very short time! We love it!
","
Works good. Very convenient for the work desk. Doesn’t charge as fast as a standard plug in charger but it does charge!
","
Easy to use
","
Bought this for my husband when he’s working at a job siteReally comes in handyLike the blue light
","
Stopped working after 2 weeks.
","
I just received  this and haven't had q chance to use it yet. I hope it lives up to my expectations.
","
This device works exactly as it says it will and saves you the frustration of always having to plug in your phone. This was a good purchase.
","
I've only had this charger for a short time but it works great, it doesn't take up much space, and it looks stylish.
","
Came exactly as pictured, easy to use. This product has been great so far and i have no complaints. Charges my pixel phone and many others!
","
Works perfectly for my iPhone XR! I havent had any problems with the wireless charger... and the charge lasts all day long. Very satisfied with this product!
","
Great product will be purchasing again
","
Works as expected, really easy to setup and use, fits in your pocket, charging time is about the same as your standard wired charger. I hope it's durable and lasts a long time.
","
This is my first wireless charger so far so good. I like that it has a light so that you can see if it’s charging or not from across the room at night.
","
Overall its a great product, it does come with a cable but I used my own because it was too short. So far I love the product:)
","
It seems slow to charge. I have the new iPhone XR. I am used to the speed of a lightning cable so I was surprised at how slow it is.
","
Very easy to use, pretty , neat!
","
My Iphone XS charging port isn't always working so this wound up being a great alternative. Works well, feels well made, no problems in 3 months.
","
Wake up many mornings with a deal phone (new Iphone 12 Pro)) due to the blue lights being lit but not actually charging the phone.  Very Hit and miss
","
I love the look of this charger! Very nice! Works great with my note 8. Actually fast charges! And for the price you can't beat the value you get from it!
","
This charger is super easy to use! Plug it in and set your phone on it. Plus it also does fast charging! Love all the color options too!
","
This is the best charger I have ever used. This charger is way better than the one given with the phone. It is also doesn’t hurt that it is very aesthetic and it is every thin.
","
No se calienta tanto y carga bien el teléfono. Lo recomiendo
","
Love this thing!!! Light isn't bright at all, you can even cover it with your phone. Charges pretty fast, don't have to keep trying to get it on perfect, it's great
","
Like the ease of charging my phone or ear buds by just laying it down on my night stand.
","
It charged very slowly and then two days later it just qiut working.
","
If you don’t place your phone on the charger just right it won’t charge plus it takes a long time for your phone to charge
","
Great charger. Powerful and easy to use.  I wanted to keep it next to my bed, but the light stays on. It’s too bright and bothers my wife.
","
Loving this wireless charger. I bought it for my wireless earbuds, it's easy to set up and use. It has worked to also charge my phone. The price was great too.
","
I have been using this charger for a few months without any problems. It works w/o a compatible case. Magnetic is strong. Good product.
","
Taking my case off to charge my iPhone on my ihome alarm clock at bedtime has been a pain for years.  With the Tozo wireless charger, it’s as simple as setting my phone (with case on!) on the Tozo to charge.  So much less hassle.  Love the lights too!
","
Newly received product. So far it has been working as expected. I am really impressed with the aesthetic appeal of this charger. Recommended
","
This wireless charger is very sleek and looks great around the house on the night stand where I keep it. Highly recommend if you are interested!
","
Functions exactly as described. It's a beautiful addition to my desk and uses a USB-C instead of a micro-USB which is a huge boon for me.I had hoped it would charge my samsung galaxy watch but it cant seem to form a connection.It works beautifully for my phones though!!
","
Works on my Tozo NC7 excellently.  Nice looking, easy to set up.  Color changes from green to blue when charging.
","
I like the flexibility of this wireless charger because I don't have to find the place to plug a cable in every time I want to charge my phone or earbuds. Very easy to use.
","
I loved my first one so much that I bought one for my office. Unlike other wireless charging products that make you carefully align the battery, you can practically toss your phone on it and it charges right away. It also charges our Tozo earbuds, which makes it super useful.
","
Easy to use, no fussing with cords!
","
Very slim, very quick charging, slim, and an overall great product. My last wireless charger would heat up after a few minutes of charging, this stops charging when it heats up but goes back to charging when it cools down
","
It doesn't work on my phone and when I ordered it. It is not working.
","
I use this charger all the time for my phone. It is so easy to use and charges my phone very fast. I would highly recommend it.
","
It's fine, It works. It's not a very fast charge and your phone has to be perfectly lined up with the lights for it to work. So It's not the best charging plate.
","
Product is as described and does its job. Rose gold color accurately matches my phone color, so pleased. Happy with my purchase. Haven’t tried charging wirelessly yet, so will update rating and review if I experience issues with charging function not working.
","
This charger works great, but was especially pleased with the sharp look.  I also didn’t realize the color changes when the phone is fully charged which is a really nice feature!
","
Works great and it’s so cute. It does get a bit warm but i think I just have to remember not to overcharge my headphones
","
This worked right out of the box and is a beautiful color, matches my white set-up nicely. I haven't tested how quickly it charges yet but don't think it will be an issue!
","
Using the wireless chargers does not have me struggling with cables that much any more and it’s pretty good if you are traveling somewhere.
","
It charges fast. I use it for my ear plugs only so far. Does not charge my phone through the case.
","
This technology is very cool. Simple and easy set up. I wish it came with a base to plug the usb into the wall. But overall, really cool! Sleek looking too.
","
I love it works for all my devices except my Apple Watch series 6 but I figured it probably wouldn’t because I think the charging for the watch is different
","
I cant get to charge my phone
","
It works it said great product small enough to fit in your pocket
","
I am changing my review from 5 stars to 1. My one day old review named “Great buy!” is below.The units acquired do not charge my phone properly. I left my iPhone to charge overnight. Although my phone chimed as if it was charging, it either dropped the connection or didn’t recognize the charging pad resulting in powering down. I tried to use a second device, connected to a desktop via a USB port. It charged my phone 13% in one hour. I switched back to a charger plugged in directly into an electrical outlet. It generated another 42% charge in one hour, which is pretty terrible. Btw, I don’t have any lights in my pads, maybe they are lemons 🙊 I am going to shop around for other wireless charges, I guess.“I just got two of these chargers, in Grey, one for the living room and one for the bedroom. They were packaged well, with all instructions and parts. I wish the charging cord was longer, but so far, they both work well for iPhone 11.”
","
Great looking wireless charger connects immediately no issues been using it 2 months love it. Slower charging then the one that physically connects
","
Takes awhile to charge up but once u get a charge it can last at least 2 days before another charge is due. GREAT
","
It’s slim and doesn’t take a lot of space. Charges great and very nice look! I bought 3. I ah e one on each night stand and one in the kitchen. Love the look!
","
This is my first wireless charger, and I'm very happy with the device! I will definitely order another for the office. It has a nice slim profile, nonslip bottom, and a clean modern aesthetic. LED lights clearly indicate connection and charging. It couldn't have been easier to set up and use.
","
I don't always write product reviews, but figured this one deserves one. The quality of the product is great. It's speak, slim, & small. I love the led status lights as well. Gives it a soft glow at night. Charges my Samsung device quickly, & stays cool. I highly recommend this to anyone!
","
Works well, and seamlessly out of the box. Classiest looking wireless charger I could find, and I'll be satisfied assuming it holds up. I do wish it came with a charging adapter however
","
They’re okay . I thought they’d be betterYou have to take off your phone case to charge it
","
I dont even need a video or picture it is back on the box. I only on boxed the thing, connected it and placed me cell phones. Worked for a minute and never worked again. Only blinks. Tried it wt a few diffrent phones and same. Waste of money and time.
","
I’ve never lost my wallet. I finally did. I’m relying on this device to help me find it should this happen again. I can use GPS and an alarm sound to locate it.
","
Great wifi charger out of the box!!Charges to 80% very fast, then at normal speed.Overall best I've had to date.
","
Super sleek looking wireless charging pad! Wouldn’t mind taking this around while traveling. The lights give a nice ambiance to my room!
","
Slipped it in the flat pocket space on the dash, now my car has a charging space like a newer model.
","
Super easy to use and very convenient! Nice to be able to charge multiple devices with just setting them on as opposed to having to plug in.
","
Perfect for my desk at the office. Just set it down instead of looking for the charging cord that someone always ""borrowed""
","
I let that fact that you don't have keep plugging in a cable to charge, you just sit the device on top and it charges quick.
","
This works for me, price was reasonable and I'm pleased with this purchase. Will buy again.
","
Beautiful charger, just wish it would charge my phone quicker but otherwise great purchase.
","
Great charger.  Looks really pretty. Was surprised how thin they were. Bought 2 of them, a  white and gold and normal black one. So far no complaints!
","

 Very very thin and work great
","
In the past when my phone would not charge by the conventional plug in I would just get a new phone but decided to try this product instead. And so glad I did, it's fast charging and matches my decor.
","
You get what you pay for.  It is very touchy if you don't have your phone on this exactly perfectly (make sure the blue light comes on) then you will wake up to a dead phone.
","
It functioned perfectly. However, it came scratched but not like I wouldn't scratched it eventually. Overall, still a great product.
","
I love the sleek look and the compact size of this charger!! It is easy to transport between home and work. Phone Charges quicker than just being plugged into my laptop too.
","
My grandma has difficulty with dexterity so she often has difficulty with her wire charger. This works perfectly for her and she doesn’t have to fumble with wires anymore.
","
Even with Magsafe case on, charging is super fast.  Strong magnet.  Great value.  Why pay double the price for Apple branch.  I'm getting 2 more.
","
Great charger! Able to charge my phone easily and with a think case that hold 3 credit cards on it. It is very thin and great for traveling. It does come with a cord to USB but no outlet adapter. I just use the Apple adapter for the wall and it works perfectly. Great Product. Highly recommend
","
Bought two of these and one was giving me problems not charging. The TOZO offered to send me a replacement. The other one works fine. Thank you for the great customer service!
","
I saw this on one of my colleagues desk at work and tried it. I tried charging my phone on theirs and loved it. I placed an order right away. It works fine even with the case and the pop socket I have on my phone. I already bought two more as gifts.
","
An excellent product. It’s in our kitchen as that is a convenient place to set your phone down for a quick recharge during the day
","
It’s PERFECT for traveling. No more different USB cables to charge my phone, my AirPods or my Tozo T12. I LOVE IT!!
","

 This is great wireless charger, I love the design, rigidity, and how slim it is made. Product description matches. It is very smart, when I tried to charge the phone without wireless charging capabilities it the green light turns on and off.
","
Impressed taking it out of the box.  All metal, elegant, and durable.  Lights are on top and hardly visible while charging so it does not interfere with my sleep.  The USB C seems to charge my iphone much faster than my last charging pad.  Would purchase again!
","
I love the design of this charger. Color on the pad changes so you know if it's charging or not. Unfortunately, it's relatively weak charging doesn't really make it useful. It isn't what I was I thought it would be. I'm better off plugging my phone in.
","
kinda finnicky cuz ur phone has to be in the middle but it works nicely. definitely more convenient than plugging in ur phone at night.
