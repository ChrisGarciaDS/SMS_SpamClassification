       " 'Reviews': [\"\\nFirst, this charger looks fantastic. I got the black one and with the glass on the top, the inset lights, and the silver edge... it just looks sleek. Its super thin and as others have commented if you have a chunky charging cable then it won't sit flat but mine does. It stays in place on the table well and even though the top is glass, it holds my phone easily. I use a Pixel 7 pro with a case and it charges through it with  no problems. The lights are not obnoxiously bright and are a convenient indicator if your phone is in the right spot. Even with a case I do not have a hard time seeing the lights. It also seems to enable the charge in any orientation, not just one as others have commented. The charge is a little slower than similar chargers which doesn't bother me. Mostly because it is easy to get the phone in position to charge and easy to see when it is in the correct position. Other chargers are much much more sensitive and don't have large indicator lights.Now for the one drawback - Charging from low battery states. I have a few chargers like this because my phone sees a lot of use and being able to set it down and let it slowly charge at my desks is super convenient. Sometimes when charging overnight from a low battery state ~ less than 10%, it will not fully charge and instead will stop charging at roughly 50%. I am not sure if this is an issue with the phone or charger. It has happened more than once. It only happens during overnight charging from low battery levels. If I start charging at like 30% or more then there is no issue. If you NEED 100% in the mornings then I would not trust this charger to get you there if you have low battery at the start. Its easy enough to just unplug it and plug the phone directly in in those cases. That single drawback isn't much though and for me its a nonissue.Would recommend.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nUPDATE:  Well...I was wrong about this wireless charger and I\\'m increasing my overall rating to 5 stars.  I left my original review below.  According to the Wireless Power Consortium, this device was said to be capped at 5watts for iOS devices and I based much of my review on that assessment.  Tozo reached out to me and asked if I would be willing to use a Digital USB Tester for their product and assess it myself instead of relying on the Wireless Power Consortium assessment.  I told them I would and they sent me the following USB tester sold on Amazon here:https://www.amazon.com/MakerHawk-Multimeter-Impedance-Temperature-Voltmeter/dp/B07DCTG6LHThis tester documentation said it automatically senses the input and output direction of current.  The male USB-C end is labeled \"input\" and female end is labeled \"output\".  I tried it both with the male end plugged into the W1 and with the male end plugged into the AC adapter.  Both readings on the tester were consistent.I used several different USB-C AC adapters, including a 20w from Tozo which I like a lot.  All the adapters I used were 20w or over.  I also used a several different 100w-rated USB-C cables.  You don\\'t need a 100w-rated USB-C cable for the W1 but that is what I used.  Despite what the Wireless Power Consortium says, Tozo is right (and my prior review was wrong):  This charger easily hits 7.5w of fast charging power on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.  In fact, I was able to see fast-charging over 10w at times (see attached).  It is important to note that iPhones do not always invoke fast charging.  iPhones are hard-coded to stop fast charging once the battery reaches 80%.  To be sure I was assessing the W1\\'s full potential, I checked charging power at various battery capacities, though all were under 50%.In my prior review, I said this would \"be perfect if it performed as advertised\".  It does perform as advertised and it is perfect in my opinion; both aesthetically and functionally.  5 Stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Sorry TOZO, but your page is no longer accurate.  According to the Wireless Power Consortium, this product has the Qi Registration ID of 8123.  Unfortunately for iOS users, the W1 uses the Basic Power Profile.  What does that mean?  Well, it becomes very important which power profile a device uses after iOS 13.1.  If a device uses the Basic Power Profile, charging is capped at 5 watts for iOS devices (not 7.5 watts).  To charge at 7.5 watts, a device must use the Extended Power Profile, which this device does not have.  How do I know?  Qi devices register with the Wireless Power Consortium.  I can\\'t post a URL in a review but you can guess the website from the name.  Click on the Product Database and enter 8123 for this product.  There you can see it uses the Basic Power Profile and it is capped at 5 watts.Functionally, this is a very nicely designed charger.  It has a nice clean look and is one of the thinnest.  It works as advertised with green and blue LEDs that cast a very nice illumination through the semi-circular \\'windows\\' in the black tint on each side of the device.  It would probably be perfect if it performed as advertised.  However, it will not achieve the 7.5 watt charging rate it claims.  After iOS 13.1, all devices that use the Basic Power Profile are capped at 5 watts.  Since the charging speed could be overlooked if you aren\\'t measuring it, I thought it important to point that out for iOS users.  I bought this specifically for the fast charging feature that was advertised in this slim, nicely designed device.  Since it definitely does not have fast charging capability for iOS devices, I\\'m giving it 1 star.Also, as of this review, Amazon bestows the \"Amazon\\'s Choice\" designation for this device.  This is despite the fact that the product page is not factually accurate.  Again, as of this review, there is a large image that says, \"7.5 Watt Fast Charge Mode for iPhone Series\".  That is not accurate for this device.  I even reached out to the Wireless Power Consortium for clarification on this specific product and this is what they said:\"We maintain the Qi wireless power standard and we operate a testing and certification program.  You see that we certified the product at 5W.  It is a common problem that manufacturers claim more power than they really deliver.  The Wireless Power Consortium cannot prevent that.\"The bottom line here is that if charging your iOS device using a fast charge rate using 7.5 watts is a priority, this device cannot do that.  You will need devices that have the Extended Power Profile.  I won\\'t comment on Android devices but encourage those with Android devices to do their research since if the Wireless Power Consortium states this device is capped at 5W independent of the software ecosystem, I wonder how it could be higher for Android.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI purchased this charger for use in our camper. It's a great charger for when you're not using your phonne you can lay it on the charger to keep it fully charged without the hassle of finding a charging cable and putting it in and out of your phones.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nGot this for my Samsung Galaxy S23 phone, and love it so far.  A few things most people don't know or hasn't been mentioned much:- Most of the chargers are a little slippery - not quite glass, but polished aluminum.  The Matte Black, however, is grippy - get this one if you're concerned about your phone sliding off, it's some sort of grippy plastic, not aluminum, so the phone doesn't slide around as much- It CAN fast charge your Samsung phone - but you need a good AC adapter AND a good wire.  I recommend Anker for both.  I have the Anker 323/2 port compact charger and an Anker USB A to C premium nylon wire, and my Galaxy S23 says it's fast charging when I plunk it down, but it doesn't say that if I use the AC adapter without the Anker wire.  I guess it's an all-or-nothing deal.All in all, very happy with this purchase\\n\",\n",

It will charge then randomly stop and the LED light will turn off. If I take the phone off and wait a few it\\'ll be \"ready\" to charge again only to do the same thing.However in the years I\\'ve had it and the 3 moves since then it\\'s worked perfect.

       "  '\\nGot this product for my tozo golden x1\\'s and my phone, s22 ultra.For the x1\\'s this charger work great and I get it to charge first try.However that\\'s it.Firstly I tried my phone and the charger kept identifying it as a foreign object. Then when I finally got it aimed correctly on the pad the phone charger status told me it would take 2 hours to charge my phone starting from 55%...but that\\'s not all, it revised that ETA again to almost 5 hours.The phone also stated that the charger is non compatible and refused to fast charge. So I did some basic trouble shooting.I tested my Samsung supplied power supply and cable with the w3 charger same problem. Long charge and refusal to fast charge.Tried the Samsung power supply with tozo provided cable and w3 charger. Same issue as aboveSo now I\\'m checking cables all with the Samsung power supply.Samsung cable results in fast chargeTozo cable has same resultSo the power supply and cables aren\\'t the issue.I finally gave up in the evening and said, \"fine if it take 4 hours tonight, I guess it\\'s better to trickle charge itself anyway\". Boy was I wrong.The phone charged and gave a estimated 5 hours to full but when I woke up (7 hours elapsed) the phone stopped charging in the night and left the phone at 75%Disappointed in this product for its main function.As for the sleep friendly. It\\'s not friendly. Just because the light is small and recessed the blue led illuminates my room and I prefer a pitch black room so this thing light up like a Christmas tree in the otherwise void environment of light.I got the w3 90mm over the 100mm because it was the only charger stating a sleep friendly design (not so)I dont mind it showing me that the charger is in standby and changing to blue when charging but does it have to display that light the whole time? The standby I can understand but change the code so the charging led goes off a minute after initiation. My phone already has indicators on and off screen to indicate it is charging and pretty much any device (tozo, any Samsung I owned, Apple, google) will do the same. Having the charger indicating it is charging is redundant and a irritant for those using this for bedroom sleep use.In conclusion, I really think tozo could have done better. With the products functions and biggest of all its capability to charge. I\\'m not sure if I was suppose to get the 100mm but none of their products 65mm, 90mm and 100mm inform the consumer whether the size of pad will affect the charging capability of the device soon to be used.As for me and any s22 ultra users. I would not buy this again and I truly hope tozo can provide some clarity. I\\'m really hoping this error is mine and not the company, I put my loyalty into their ear bud products from the tozo 10, 12 and x1. I would absolutely be disappointed if this charger is in fact a 13 is dollar paper weight for the s22 ultra.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI bought this charger a year ago for myself. It’s a great charger. I’ve plugged it, unplugged it, transferred it between rooms, traveled with it, and it’s been trustworthy. I like the indicator lights that tell you when you’ve successfully placed whatever you’re charging, especially when the device isn’t able to tell you itself.\\n',\n",

The comment \"that\\'s a really cool coaster\" has been heard at least twice.The LED indicators are very helpful in knowing what the charging status is, and the green while nothing is charging looks really nice in the dark.There\\'s one thing to be aware-of though, the glass on top seems to scratch very easily... I accidentally scratched one of them pretty badly with my fingernail trying to remove a sticker.

       "  \"\\nMy Pixel 7a only supports 5W wireless charging, but even so it should easily charge to full overnight. But this charger only ever seemed to get it to about 80% and would leave the phone quite hot. Also, although there is only a single small LED, it was bright enough to bother me on my nightstand. I bought a similar form factor charger from another brand which consistently charges my phone to 100%, doesn't make it hot, and where the LEDs (which are a circle around the whole pad) shut off after just a few seconds once you put your phone on it.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nLet me just say(given that I have had this for less than 24 hours)Pros:Charges through fabricsSLEEK, I mean very nice looking. It’s made of some type of metal and has a firmly rooted base given the 4 foot silicone pad distribution, and what I can only assume is a slightly more weighted bottom, designed to eliminate sliding of the charger at any point.This is a major plus for me. Although I live in EVER flat Florida where inclines are not terribly of concern, I detest the sliding that seems to be inevitable with all other wireless chargers and any surface without enough texture to repel sliding. This will occur regardless of how flat your region is, and I personally don’t like to ever have to worry about this becauseMy phone must be removed from its protective casing in order to charge.If you’re like me and have always wondered why wireless chargers felt so damn flimsy, like two cheap pieces of plastic glued over a chip/board and maybe a flimsy ring of silicone atop the surface to “deter” slide.First off, hell na. Leaving my phone or devices wirelessly charging means they will be exposed to all other forces or nature in the house, however restrictive or graceful or hurried they may be, so NO I do not like to play around given these circumstances.All aside these pros, the design of the sleek cool weighted metal is one that leaves me feeling like I have a significantly higher end product than the cost would have eluded to.Super happy so far!CONSHighly rapid I am to assume, IF ONLY it came with the high speed charging cable (3.0) required to enable HIgh speed battery charges so I could test thiSOtherwise nothing, this item has far exceeded my expectations given the price, but not given the company, which I have been recently introduced to and which is seemingly determined to output some reliable products which SURPRISE SURPRISE, perform at or better than advertised specs. Thank you TOZO. And please continue making products like these, they far outweigh the majority of competitors in terms of quality and what I can only assume is a lot of user testing.Note..

       "  '\\nPurchased in June 2022…….worked……died December 31, 2022.Followed the Amazon links for the manufacturer trouble shooting advice…..got a 404 messsage that the website no longer exists.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!- - - - - UPDATE 3-30-23 - - - - - -The TOZO manufacturer reached out to me after seeing my previous 2* review. The told me there had in fact been a defect in the charger that I had purchased. They offered me a upgraded replacement and I accepted.This is a great example of Honest and Fair Customer Service and I appreciate their follow-up after my negative experience.  The new charger was sent immediately and is working great!!!\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nI have tested numerous Charging Pads or Stations.  I bought a Halo Charging Station, $35, with three different ports on side of unit, USB A, C, etc.  They worked fine.  However, the main function of the unit, the top charging pad, was useless.  Nothing would charge.  Moreover, I tried quite a few other standard charging pads, all either did not work at all, or charged so slow they were useless.  This Tozo Pad W3, worked immediately and charges very quickly.  I have to say, Tozo products as a whole are quality and never fail in performance.  I own, or have owned four or five different styles of their earbuds, all great.  I have given Tozo products as gifts always good feedback.  Pricing of Tozo products is phenomenally low in view of quality and performance.  I highly recommend the W3 Pad.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI love this charger so much that I bought 4 of them!!  They charge quickly and are beautiful too!I leave it plugged in all the time and just put my earbuds or phone on it whenever.  Best buy ever!!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThis charger (M-100mm model, 5.3 mm thickness) is so thin that if you put your phone on it parallel to its power cable (see photo), then your phone is not going to rest fully on the surface of the charging pad but form a bridge between the power cable and the opposite edge of the charging pad (see photos). The thinnest USB-C plug I've found is 6.5 mm thick, so the gap can be as little as 0.6 mm and Your phone will be close enough to charge OK, but over time the phone will show signs of wear as the pad rubs it at the two small points of contact.To avoid that you can put your phone on the pad at 90 degrees to the pad's power cable (see photo), but then your phone will entirely block the pad's indicator lights and you won't get visual confirmation that your phone is charging or an indication of when the phone is charged.This doesn't make the pad entirely useless, it just makes its indicator lights mostly useless, and you can place your phone at an awkward angle to see part of the indicator light. Not a problem if you don't care much about the design of the everyday things in your life, but if you value good design this could be an issue for you. An issue which could have been entirely avoided by having the indicator lights at 90 degrees from where they are now, or by having 4 indicator lights at 90 degrees from each other instead of 2 lights at 180 degrees as in the current design. A missed opportunity.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nOk. So here is another amaizing product from tozo.One of my fastest and smallest chargers. Its listed for the IPhone's which I don't know much about iPhones. So I bought it for my wife thinking I know she has one this will probably work for her. Apparently it doesn't oh, but not because of the design of the charger, but because my wife has an older iPhone and it does not have the special magnetic connection for the fast charger. So now I use it is a Ultra portable super small wireless charging station for my Tozo wireless charging headphones. So i provided a picture of it sitting beside the total number W1 wireless charging pad which is ultra thin and wide. That one normally sits next to my bed for my phone. But I have so many of these wireless headphones that I purchased throughout the last two years from tozo oh, that my phone competes with them for the charging. Since my wife's phone doesn't have the special maintenance in the back of her phone I get to keep this little guy. Some great features about this is said it's small, it has a c type plug so it doesn't matter which direction you plug it in. I have a battery packs if this connect to that has the C type female plug. Which allows me to use the regular USB for other items that I'm charging. It has a very long cord it's about 3 ft long so it doesn't need to be so close to the wall charger or other items I'm charging. And it charges fast. Tozo has some of the fastest Chargers I've ever owned, it took my phone from 5% to 100% in less than an hour. Totally ridiculous on speed. It took my headphones from completely dead to 100% in about 30 minutes. All I can say is if you're buying from tozo, chances are you're going to love the item. I heard about these guys about 2 years ago when I was looking for headphones and now I have about a dozen items from them. The warranty is by far the best I've ever had, as if there's an issue you simply email them and they get back to you within a day. I tested this out just to see how long it would take for them to contact me, fortunately I've never had to use it, not a single one of my items has failed me. And I have a set of wireless charging headphones that are 2 years old oh, and I still get 6 hours of use form the headphone every time I use them each. Love their products. Thanks tozo\\n\",\n",

Works well with Pixel 6 phone, but does not deliver the full advertised power.The label on the unit says 5v-2A or 9v-1.57A, but it does not actually draw or provide that much charging power. I tested this charger with a Pixel 6 phone, both with the case on the phone and off the phone. I tested with multiple USB power bricks. With a Google USB-C power brick that supports PD, the charger negotiated 9 volts and when charging it drew between 6 and 7 watts, not the full 10 watts as advertised, but it did work reliably.  When I tested with a USB-A power brick, the charger only drew about 3.5 watts. Note that the charger comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable, so you need to use a different cable with a USB-C brick that supports PD to get the highest charging rate.Note the green LEDs on the pad (which turn blue when charging). The LEDs cannot be turned off, so be aware of this if you plan to use it in a bedroom.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nI do not often write reviews, but maybe this will help others. My search for a magsafe compatible wireless charger. TLDR - the Tozo W6 checked all the boxes for me.I compared the top 3 rated chargers (as of Jan 2021), the Tozo, the RAVPower, and the Yootech. My devices - iPhone 12 Pro Max and Air Pods Pro. I have a bumper case with a clear polycarbonate back. I did not remove the case for testing. The polycarbonate back is approximately 1.5 mm thick.Magnet - The Tozo locked in place and stayed put. Not easy to bump loose and knock off. The other two chargers were easy to bump loose and the magnets were much weaker.Cord - The Tozo cord is heftier than the RAVPower cord. They are both about the same length, 38 to 39 in. The Yootech cord was the most substantial and about 60 in long.Construction - The Tozo is solidly built and feels more substantial in hand. The other two, not so much. Without putting them on a postal scale for exact weights, I will say the Tozo feels like it weighs more than the others and that probably explains why the magnetic attachment seems so much better on this one. The Tozo also had the smallest diameter of the 3, 2 5/16 in or 58 mm.Compatibility with charging bricks. I am always trying out different charging bricks. By charging brick, I mean those chargers that have multiple USB-C and multiple USB A ports. I like a clean desk and don't want a bunch of individual chargers plugged in. I tested using both C and A ports. Your mileage may vary. I buy bricks that have the highest output power I can find. The Yootech was finicky and not so compatible. The Tozo and RAVPower both worked well with most of my bricks.Magsafe Compatibility - The Tozo was the only charger that would consistently trigger the iPhone to display the Magsafe charging ring.\\n\",\n",

The wattage is lower, and also note that you will lose watts between the phone and charger. If you don't know that much about electronics you should probably at least know that if you purchase this you more than likely want to buy it along with its wall plug as plugs may differ in voltage and maximum amp draw.

       "  '\\nI own a new Samsung S21 Ultra and was looking for a wireless charger that did the job fast, looked premium and doesn\\'t take up a lot of space on the nightstand. This little gadget does the trick and fulfills or exceeds each requirement!First, it\\'s a good weight and the casing is made of metal. The charger has a small foot print but large enough \"sweet spot\" for the connection to be made with the phone. Also, I love how low profile it is. This disc is maybe an 1/8\" thick. 1/4\" at most. I haven\\'t actually measured it myself. It would also be very easy to grab and go for traveling as the disc disconnects from the provided USB-C cable at the disc itself. So I\\'ll keep a spare cable and brick in my bag and take this until my second one comes in.Yep I ordered a second one for \"on the go\" places and also ordered one for my Mom\\'s iPhone. She\\'ll love it.Oh, how could I forget? You probably want to know how fast it charges. Well, from what I can tell, I last had about 20% juice left on my phone and it charged it to 100% in about an hour and a half. Maybe slightly longer. In wireless charging terms, that\\'s fast! Now I do have it paired with a 5A 30w brick, to be fair and this phone is brand new. But still, the one I previously purchased which was the ugly white plastic folding travel charger that could also accommodate ear buds and a watch was PAINFULLY slow. This crushes the competition and the price is less than half of the big hunk of junk I bought a few weeks ago on here.I\\'m very happy with this purchase and would advise you to give it a try and quit torturing yourself as to finding the right charger. This is it. This is the right charger. And I\\'m super picky about form and function. Give it a try, make sure you have a really good brick and enjoy!

I’m not really satisfied with it though, and here are my reasons:1) the smaller size makes it a little more challenging to line up my phone with it to start charging.  There are no indicator lights like on the W1 model, so I have to rely on my phone’s screen to see if it has started charging (which takes longer, meaning adjusting to find the sweet spot takes longer).2) the magnetic feature doesn’t work through my phone case (and it’s not a particularly thick case).  This may be part of why it’s so hard to line up for charging.3) the USB power cord does not unplug from the charging disc, it is hard wired.  This concerns me, since if I am using it for travel it will be thrown into bags and pockets where the cord will eventually wear out, and I won’t be able to replace it.  The W1 model, though bigger, has a power cord that disconnects and I can replace it with any USB-C cable (along the same lines, I already have other devices that take a USB-C cable and I could easily swap them between devices as needed).So, the quality of this appears to be good; no defects to the best of my knowledge and it seems solid.  If the above issues are of no concern to you, then I recommend it.  For me though, this design doesn’t fit my needs.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nSo far, the W6 has done it's job nicely for me.  I have an iPhone 11 and it has no problems mating with that.  I use a phone case and I can still feel the magnet telling me where to align to.  I don't depend on a wireless charger to hang off the back while I'm using it, so I don't need something that grips to that extent.  I also don't have any larger accessory that this needs to fit into - I just use it as a standalone additional wireless charger so I don't always have to walk back to my bedroom to charge.  This is also nice as a travel charger since it's smaller than my combo watch/phone wireless charger I typically use.It's sleek, lightweight, and seems well built.  It also has an included adapter to use for old style USB connections to computers vs the newer USB-C.One suggestion I would make that would be a cheap convenient addition would be to add a couple of non-stick stickers/adhesives so this could be set on a slicker surface without risking that it slides off.  Because it's smaller and lighter, when set upon a surface like a marble countertop, it can possibly slip off.  When a device is on top and it's actively charging, this isn't an issue as the weight of the device provides enough weight to keep it in place.  But just 3-4 optional small non-slip stickers that could be applied to the bottom would be a nice cheap addition.I haven't found that this gets hot, which is typically a sign of good efficiency.  I haven't compared how quickly this charges vs other models, but for my purposes (charging 1x a day typically overnight), any wireless charger I use doesn't need to be ultra-fast.All in all, a nicely priced, good quality wireless charging pad that's flexible and nicely compact for travel.\\n\",\n",

As far as I can tell the lights don't ever turn off, might be annoying on the bedside table but since this lives on my desk I don't really mind, I can clearly see when it has power just by glancing at it.Last thing about it is charging speed, I don't really have much experience with QI and none of my devices support it, with the exception of my mouse (what I got it for) and one pair of TWS headphones. I have no idea what the rated QI speeds for either of these are, but what I do know is that it is a bit slow, especially compared to the Type C supercharging speeds I'm used to. The mouse normally should take 2 hours to charge fully over Type C, when I use this QI pad it takes about 2 hours to charge 5-10%. Might be the mouse, who knows, I don't really care because I leave it to top-up charge overnight. Just something to keep in mind.\\n\",\n",

Changes to blue when charging. This didn't bother me.Charge test using the the Google 30 Watt PPS power brick, Google USB-C cable, and Pixel 6 Pro with optimized charging off to get the full charge delivered, the screenshot shows the numbers the Tozo generated pulled using the Accubattery Pro app.4.077 V * (1974 mA/1000) = 8.048 wattsLess than the 10 it advertises using optimal power brick and USB-C cable that came with the Pixel Stand gen 2.The most likely reason for this is the Tozo Qi charger didn't have extended power profile (EPP) and instead uses the basic power profile according to the wireless power consortium. I must take a star off for this.However, for the price point and aesthetic qualities, this is a good travel charger for when you wish to charge overnight while resting. If you need something quicker for day use, I'd recommend going for a Qi charger with EPP.\\n\",\n",

This wireless charger is very thin and sturdy, made of high quality aluminum, making it easy when traveling. Lights glow green when plugged into power and turn blue when charging your phone or earbuds. It sits on my nightstand by my bed and the lights are not bright enough to bother me when sleeping.

Well I used it once...the earbuds actually have a long battery life which I love! But one day after learning I had covid and missing the bus at the hospital I had to walk home during which I had my buds in.  I had the case clipped to my beltstrap in the Tozo holder I also bought and at some point the bud case fell out of the holder and I didn't realize until getting home.. I felt too bad to walk to find them and spent next 2 weeks in bed.  I had purchased the extended warranty too which was a waste because the girl said it doesn't cover lost items.  Well the charger is back in the box in a drawer somewhere..the buds with the worthless neoprene case holder thrown on a shelf.  I would advise just throwing the bud case in a pocket or purse.

Just lay it on top, make sure it’s in the proper position, and go about your business, the device should be charged in a reasonable amount of time. I haven’t officially compared charging times between this and USB-C, but they seem pretty close. I wonder if people who complain about slow charging times have plugged this device into a slow charging unit, or have used an inferior cable. It does take a little bit of trial and error to get a larger device properly positioned, but it’s not rocket science: you quickly learn the basic skill.

I was looking for a new Qi charger that uses the USB-C standard to simplify the number of cables I need.  The charger itself seems like it’s made from decent quality materials and has a nice weight to it.  However, it does not meet up to the claims of fast charging.Before anyone chimes in and says I need “this charger” or “that charger”, let me tell you how I came to this conclusion.TEST ONEEquipment used:• TOZO W1 Qi Charger• OEM Samsung\\'s Super-Fast Charger (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)• OEM Samsung OEM USB C cable (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)Result: The phone displays \"Fast Wireless Charging” but drops to “Wireless Charging” after a few seconds.  As an example, the time to charge goes from 1 hour to about 1 hour 34 minutes when this occurs.NOTE: Also tested this combination with the TOZO supplied USB C cable with no change to result.TEST TWOEquipment used:• TOZO W1 Qi Charger• OEM Samsung\\'s Fast Charger (From my NOTE9)• Known good USB B to USB C cable (New)Result: The phone displays \"Fast Wireless Charging” but drops to “Wireless Charging” after a few seconds.  As an example, the time to charge goes from 1 hour to about 1 hour 34 minutes when this occurs.TEST THREEEquipment used:• YOOTECH Qi Charger (I’ve had it for a few years)• OEM Samsung\\'s Super-Fast Charger (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)• OEM Samsung OEM USB C cable (New – from my NOTE20 Ultra 5G)Result: The phone displays \"Fast Wireless Charging” and STAYS in fast wireless charging mode.TEST FOUREquipment used:• YOOTECH Qi Charger (I’ve had it for a few years)• OEM Samsung\\'s Fast Charger (From my NOTE9)• Known good USB B to USB C cable (New)Result: The phone displays \"Fast Wireless Charging” and STAYS in fast wireless charging mode.The above results were 100% consistent and repeatable.  My phone is new (less than 2 weeks old) and by swapping to a different Qi charger, proved both sets of charging blocks and cables were not the issue.  The issue followed the TOZO M1 Qi Charger.Is the charger defective? Maybe.  Is the charger weak and the specifications in the add misleading? Perhaps.  TOZO claim 8mm of separation (gap) is possible for Qi charging, but do not go as far as to claim fast charging is available at that distance.  My NOTE20 Ultra is in a WallSkin Turtle case.  It’s not super thin, but not 8mm thick either.  My YooTech Qi chargers (I have several) ALL can Fast charge thru the case.  The TOZO W1 Qi charger cannot maintain a Fast Charge even with the proper cables and charge block.  I will not be taking my phone out of a case to charge it every other day, that would be crazy.  So this item did not work for me.  I’m speculating that the item I received is defective or to get the thin size corners were cut and I need to have the back of the phone touching the Qi charger for it to work.  I would rather spend a few dollars more and get a ‘working’ Qi charger that meets my needs.I have attached a video to show a sample of the test I did and why I say it does not fast charge.  If TOZA cares to watch and respond to my review, I will listen,  but otherwise this item is going back before the return window closes.  (defective/ not as described) I give it two stars at this time because of build quality.\\n',\n",

I don\\'t even have to think about it any more... plop it on the disc & go about my business without another thought.  The charge starts up immediately and will rev a full charge if left a little while...does not take \"forever\", not at all!  Only a little slower....  Was a great purchase for myself and made a terrific, practical little gift as well!  BTW, I bought myself a second one to have on my nightstand. 👍.

If this is in your room, it may keep you up at night if you're sensitive to light (since they're green).  The competitor (ahem) has a light that turns off after two minutes of activity.  In my opinion, that's a superior design choice.  I simply plug it into a power strip now, and switch off the power strip.  An extra step.That being said, it is beautifully machined, it's heavy so it doesn't move on you, and it has some neat circuitry that detects that my pocket knife is not my phone (and it refuses to charge in that case.)  Its design is aesthetically pleasing.It also doesn't come with a power brick that goes in the wall, only a USB cable.  This is fine, they disclosed that in the advertisement.  However, now, I have an extra USB to Lightning cable.  I believe every cable needs a partnering wall brick, and now there has been a disturbance in the force and I need to restore balance.  It's surprisingly hard to find a wall brick from a reputable company (i.e. Anker, etc) that uses the standard USB connector and is a small size.\\n\",\n",

I purchased gold, which not only matches my phone but also matches my mid century modern setup in my bedroom.I was a little weary about the green and blue light that emits from the charger (green when being unused and blue when charging) because I like my room pitch dark when I sleep, but I can honestly say that the light doesn't bother me and I barely notice it now.When I first started using the charger, it was taking a very long time to charge my iPhone 11 Pro Max for some reason. In one hour it charged maybe 6-7% of battery, which I found strange. I later realized that you have to peel off the little plastic that comes on top of the charger. Even though I wanted to keep it on to give it an extra layer of protection from scratches, I do think that little piece of plastic affects the way your device is charged. Now, I just put my phone on top of the charger when I'm ready for bed, and when I wake up, my phone is 100% charged. It does not charge as quickly as the lightening cord, but I do not find an issue with that. When I need my phone charged quickly, I will just switch to the lightening cord. This wireless charger also charges the Apple AirPods wireless version. I'm sure this charger will have no issue with charging anything that is wireless charge compatible.Not having an AC adapter did not really bother me since in today's day and age you can find an AC adapter pretty much anywhere!This product also comes with a one year warranty which gives me more confidence in the product.Overall, I am happy with the price, the product and the customer service from Tozo!\\n\",\n",

I would say just have a full circle instead and it would be so much better.Another is the LEDs again are always on. If it were on only able to sleep when not in use it would be fantastic.Finally the issue that it doesn't come with a plug in for the wall to support fast charging is a big problem.

It also wasn't quite long enough for me to use my phone in the bed.  If I wanted to use it, I'd have to unplug it, then plug it back in when done.  I know - these are very minor issues but this wireless charger is a good price, and it just took away those minor inconveniences.When I was trying to decide which one to get, this one caught my eye.  When it came, I wasn't disappointed.  It has a very modern look to it and looks very durable.  I love that fact it's made from aluminum and glass and not plastic.  It is also very thin.  The LEDs change from green to blue when your phone is charging.  They also change back to green when it's finished. I can't really comment on the longevity since I've only had it since Christmas.One thing to note - I saw some reviews saying it stopped working.  This charger calls for an adapter that will output 2 AMPS.  The little ones that come with an iPhone are only rated for 1 AMP.  I noticed mine getting very hot and it shut off on me. I just unplugged the adapter from the wall and plugged it back in and it started working again.  Plug it into a 2 AMP adapter and it will work fine.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nUpdated 12/2019 - the most important thing to understand when purchasing a wireless charger is that the rate which matters i.e. watts is determined by your phone not the charger. so if your phone is for example a Samsung S10e your max wireless charge rate is 5W. Even within the same model line there can be differences. My Note10+ has a max rate of 15W so i can take full advantage of this charger's maximum rate but if i had the Note10 I would be limited to 10W. point being how fast your phone will charge using this depends entirely on your phone. when looking for a wireless charger check your phone's specifications first and then find a charger that is equal to or greater in output. as for the charger so far? not a problem, bug or issue.The charger works and looks great with the Note10+.As they state you’ll need an usb adapter to supply power for this device. I already had a 15W charger on hand and used that one. FYI it is a micro usb NOT a usb type c connection. I also used a longer cable for placement reasons.Quality of materials is better than I expected. The center white portion looks like glass but it isn’t. The led lights change color to show you charge status e.g. active or paused/stopped. On the bottom are two rubber pads so it not only stays put but it won’t ever scratch anything either. As for charging time that of course depends on the adapter you use with. That said I was surprised to find that the difference in charge times when my Samsung Note is placed on the wireless charger fills the battery at a rate approximately 2/3 that of the stock charger, according to my phone’s display.All in all I really like this and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to my family or friends.\\n\",\n",

The light stays on all the time the unit is plugged in (it changes color from green to blue when charging is complete, but remains on).2. The included cable is USB-C to USB-A. The USB-C end connects to the puck, leaving the USB-A end to connect to your wall adapter. If you have a newer-style adapter with a USB-C connection, you'll need a different cable (which you may want anyway, since the included cable is only about 3 feet long, so won't work unless you're placing the charger right above a wall outlet).\\n\",\n",

It has to be plugged in to charge your phone or ear buds or whatever, so what's the point?  You can just as easily plug in your device and charge it directly.  I know there must be more to this than I'm understanding but I'm at a loss.  I got this because I bought some wireless ear buds and assumed I needed it to charge them.  Turns out I don't.  I can charge the ear buds in their case directly using a regular cable and adapter.  So why do I have this?  I'm going to keep it because it's kind of cool and I'm hoping I'll figure it out somewhere down the line.  It charges quickly and works well.  I have an LG Rebel4 so I can't use it for that but that's OK.  Maybe when I upgrade.  Hoping someone will be kind enough to clue this old hippie in on what I'm missing.\\n\",\n",

So I wouldn’t use this as a “fast charge” maybe an overnight charge, I think I’ll stick to my cord charger if Im on a time limit.

       "  '\\nI’ve had this wireless charger for about two months and I use it approximately every other night to charge my iPhone 11 Pro. It can’t get much easier than setting your phone on a disk — no more fishing for cables or trying to plug in the phone in the dark. The light it emits is pretty bright in a dim room, so on charging nights I set my phone so it covers the lights, and on non-charging nights I simply flip the disk over so the light won’t bother me. The charger generally works consistently, although I’ve learned to verify that the phone recognizes the charge before I go to sleep. (Once in a while, the phone doesn’t seem to recognize that it’s on a charger despite being solidly centered; I don’t know whether that’s an issue with the phone or the charger, but picking up the phone and setting it back down on the disk usually corrects the issue.)Overall I’m very happy with the charger. It’s attractive, minimalist, and of sturdy quality. However, I knocked off one star because the company emailed me after purchase to offer a free second charger if I write a five-star review. To put it mildly, I was disappointed to receive such an email. I really don’t appreciate a company trying to buy five star reviews in exchange for free product. I wish they would let the charger stand on its own merit because it’s a great product and I would have given it five stars.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUPDATE: Tozo contacted me and sent me a free replacement that works great. Added two stars. Very satisfied, still find the bright LEDs vaguely annoying but I’m good at positioning my phone perfectly to cover them.I am using the Tozo with an iPhone 8+ to charge it at night, plugged into a quick charge USB plug.Every night I have to unplug the Tozo and plug it back in to get it to charge my phone, basically negating it’s purpose of me just setting my phone on it and going to sleep. I could just plug in my phone instead, and probably will once I get tired of being annoyed by this thing.Once replugged in it will not charge my phone from under 10% to 100%; it usually stops charging around 70, which if I notice in the night means I have to unplug it and plug it back in again and from there most times it still won’t charge all the way to 100 before stopping.The LED lights on it are extremely bright. You need to lay your phone on the charger a specific way at night to cover them, which is fine, but if you wake up in the middle of the night, check the time and see you’re charged enough and don’t lay it on the charger, or put it on the charger at an angle, the  lights will light up your room.It does charge without trouble through my SPIGEN case, and using the quick charge USB plug charges it acceptably fast for overnight charging, when it works, which it barely does.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nIv had this charger for a little over a month now and from what I’ve learned about it so far is: The outlet I use to charge my device has to be a certain voltage or it will literally take all night. This type charging device is good to use when your phone is at atleast 75% and you want a quick charge to get your phone back to 100%. Right now the charging time is 2 and half to 3 hours if my phone is less that 50%. And and hour to an hour and a half if it’s at atleast 65%. I like the charging pad in itself it has a very nice sleek design but if I decide to purchase another one, it will be one that is specifically designed for an iPhone 11. Oh an not to mention it causes my phone to run hot especially if the outlet I use has poor voltage power, as I said it’s an ok charger but i don’t think it’s compatible to an iPhone 11.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nMy charging port is wearing out. So instead of spending hundreds on a new phone I figured why not try a wireless charger? My phone has the ability and works great on my brother's wireless charger so.... perfect solution! Well....this charger is a piece of cr**. I've tried it multiple times and only been able to charge my phone once.Issue 1. I keep my phone by my bed because I use it as my alarm. So it's of the utmost importance that it be charged. So the light was a big deal for me. So I chose the option with one little light on the front (not the ones with the two light strips on the side). Boy was the one single light points bright! After waking up multiple times I got up and put some tape and paper over the light. It still shone through but was finally dim enough to sleep. If you sleep with your phone by your bed and need all device lights to be as dim as possible then this product isn't for you. If you like sleeping next to a beacon, then this might be your thing!Issue 2. And, honestly, this is the only issue that matters because it's a CHARGER....it doesn't charge. The first night I had this charger I spent five minutes trying to get it to charge.....moving it around and around and around looking for that sweet spot. Taking my phone case off, turning it up and down, trying different outlets and USB pots, etc. Finally my phone buzzed that it was charging! I had the next day off so I didn't have an alarm set. Woke up to an almost dead phone though. So while I was making coffee I did the same thing. Searched for that gosh darn sweet spot for quite a few minutes (is this how guys feel?). Finally got it charging and my phone got to 100%. Figured the first night must've been a fluke. Nope! I woke up this morning for work to my 4:45am alarm and a notification that my phone was about to go to sleep because it was almost drained. THANK GOD I didn't miss my 6am shift and that my battery made it until the alarm went off. I was furious though because when I had gone to bed I had spent yet another solid five to ten minutes moving my phone around the pad until it vibrated and showed the charging notification. I made sure not to move it once I'd found that sweet spot. I ended up charging my phone in my car on the way to work and got it up to 5% to make it through the day with minimal use. Got home with 1% battery and tried the charger again. This time I couldn't even get it to notify me it was charging after fifteen minutes of once again trying to find that sweet, sweet, sweet spot. I tried EVERYTHING yet again. Different outlets. Different USB ports. Different USB cables. Taking my case off. Turning the phone face side up and face side down. If I'd had some positive vibes left I would've sent those to it as well. Maybe some sage? But nope. I was just full of negative energy about this stupid charging device. So back to the seller it goes! Save yourself the trouble (and anxiety) and buy anything else. I cannot stress how much of a piece of s*** this is.\\n\",\n",

At my office desk, I had tendency to pick up and put down my phone a lot. Leaving my phone with a low battery at the end of the day.The solution: This wireless charger fit my needs, and more. It was a gorgeous, sleek design. I was particularly drawn to the white color with Rose Gold trim. It was very convenient and easy to keep by phone charged throughout my day. I was happy to have it on my white desk over looking at a mundane charging cord. I own an iPhone so I’m aware that a very fast charging speed is not possible. Overall, I was pretty happy with the charging speed this product offers my phone.Sad moment: I really like this product. And I felt a little sad when the product unexpectedly stopped charging my phone. I also don’t want to go back to cords. I now have a very bad habit of picking up my phone and yanking on the charging cord because I forgot it was plugged. For 5 months, it worked perfectly with no issues until now. I tried different methods to resolve this on my own. Now I’ve contacted the company, and I hope to hear back soon.\\n',\n",

They are cheap but decent for the money.In my house we routinely charge 5 iPhones and a Samsung Galaxy across 3 of these chargers and generally all functions well. Once in a while a device might need to be reseated as the charging pad will just blink green. We have one iPhone that does this more often than any other but I believe that is due to the magnet case that is on it. Even then, it still usually works.The green light stays on all the time but even when no device is charging the green glow is unobtrusive. The light can be hidden entirely by most devices when charging.I bought fast charging adapters to plug these into but haven’t done any tests yet to check for the time difference with and without the fast charging adapters.All-in-all, these perform well for a pretty cheap price, $10/ea.\\n',\n",

I also really like that it doesn't require my Bluetooth to be enable to link with my phone to charge it wirelessly.Overall, it's a great product. There have been those few nights when I woke up in the morning and realized that because my phone wasn't perfectly alligned to the charging pad, it didn't charge.

You do need to make sure to get the receiver in your device lined up on the charger, so the first couple of times you might have to shift the device around a few times - this is going to happen regardless of what charger you use.When it detects the device, the color LEDs change from green to blue and the charging starts.  The feedback happens quickly - within a half a second, so it's real easy to tell when you have the device correctly positioned.It's a lot smaller than I expected, which is a great thing.  I didn't have to make space to put it on the nightstand - its low profile and small radius make it super easy to fit pretty much wherever you want it.It's also pretty durable.  Its top side has a slick surface (I think it's tempered glass, but don't quote me on that), and so far through fairly average use over 9 months I haven't dented, scratched, or cracked it.  That includes accidentally dropping it 3 feet to the floor a few times.My only criticism is that its status LEDs/lights are surprisingly bright.  It appears the only way to turn them off is to unplug the charger, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a wireless charger.  It's easy to cover them up with a phone while it charges overnight, but if you decide not to cover the phone they are bright enough that in a dark room they can distract from sleep.  Counter-argument: It makes it very easy to see where to place the phone when coming home late and night and not bothering to turn on the room lighting before hopping in bed.\\n\",\n",

Not only do I no longer slowly lose my charge, but I find that my phone charges really quickly with this wireless charger. Lastly, my last charger which was triangular-shaped, I had to center my phone almost perfectly in order for it to charge.

It is thin, with a nicely polished glass top, shiny metal bevels, and black (or white) body; the black version looks really good under my (black/charcoal/whatever they called it that year) iPhone X.Charging works fine. This is not a miracle device; you need to place the phone roughly centered on the charging disk. As with all Qi, a few millimeters of non-metallic case are okay, but naked really does work best. Note that Qi charging is inherently a bit slower than through a USB cable, and that's true here as well.This disk comes with a (USB-C on body to USB-A) cable but no charger. Any USB power source will do (Apple brick, commercial charger, laptop, etc.) but to charge at maximum rate you need a 2A (10W) power source. The charger that came with your phone will do. A standard USB port will work, but will charge more slowly.Status is indicated by two illuminated colored arcs on the top plate that turn blue when charging. I don't find them bright enough to disturb me, but they are fairly prominent. If they bother you, when charging to you can place your phone across to cover them. (They are still lit when phone-less.)No opinion on durability yet. It comes with a 1 year warranty (requires registration).\\n\",\n",

No complaints so far about its charging ability either. To be honest I only use this while I’m asleep, so I can’t say much about the charging speed, besides the fact that it’s always at 100% when I wake up. I see some other reviews with complaints about the phone placement needed for it to charge, but I never have that issue. Yes, there are times when I have to adjust it a bit to make it charge, but as long as you put it mostly centered it will work. To be fair though this is actually my first wireless charger, so I’m not sure how the charging area and speed compares to others. There is also an LED ring that shows if it is charging, so it’s super easy to tell when it is. I might buy another one for my work desk. I got the rose gold which is shown in my picture.P.S. Comes with a decent USB-C cord as well, I can never get too many of those. I do wish the cord was longer though.\\n',\n",

TOZO\\'s \"fast charging\" marketing is a stretch, especially for users of late-model Apple iPhones with larger batteries. Android smartphones such as the Motorola and Samsung with Qi charging can allegedly pull more out of the TOZO, but don\\'t expect this plate to charge your iPhone 13 Pro Max from 20% to 80% in less than 45 minutes... and that\\'s with a highly-rated and proven AC adapter built using Qualcomm\\'s QC v3.0 technology.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nSleek design.  Of the same output power as the Apple branded charger, but at half the price.While the cable is USB C like that of the Apple charger, this unit comes with a USB C to USB A adapter to solve the Apple issue of not including an AC Wall adapter with your new phone.  Ostensibly, you’re expected to use an older AC adapter that you have lying around, but it would be very unlikely that most folks have a USB C adapter around.  In reality, it’s another thing you have to buy just to use your new phone or new Apple Magsafe charger.This unit solves this issue by including an adapter from USB C to USB A.  If you DO have a USB C power adapter or wish to use a compatible power bank or computer port, you can still use USB C for faster charging.  In absence of those things, you can actually use your older USB A wall adapter and save the $18 Apple charges for theirs.This unit will charge through an Otterbox case, so I would assume most other cases also.  The magnetic grip is dramatically reduced through the case as you’d expect.  But, it still seems to hold well enough to pick the phone up and use it without the charger falling off the phone.\\n',\n",

However I expected the overall size to be bigger. the diameter measures 3 7/8” which makes this extremely compact for travel yet big enough for your phone to rest on and still see the charging light.There are two colors for the charging lights. Green and blue. The green light stays on when the unit is idle. Blue indicates charging. Even though the light is bright on the charger, the light lines are so thin that it won’t light up a room. You can keep it on your nightstand and it won’t bother you at all.Wireless charging is slower than direct wiring. But not that much slower. I’ve tried it with my phone case on and off. As you can imagine direct to phone is faster than with the case on. However not so much that that it will make enough of a difference that it would chose you not to use the case or use this charger at all. (If you have an armored case like an Otterbox defender it may not charge at all. When buying a new phone case it will tell you if it is wireless charging capable). I have an iPhone XR. If the phone is below a 20% charge it takes about 3-3 1/2 hours to give it a full charge with the case on.The only negative I have to mention, and it’s very minor, is that because of the high polished surface of this charger your phone could potentially slide of the charger if the table it’s on is bumped. If you are using a non slip case it won’t be a problem. But I have a tempered glass case which makes it A bit slippery.Overall this is an excellent charger and I highly recommend it.\\n',\n",

Very nice looking device and pretty easy set up - just plug it in and drop a device on top.  Certainly compact enough for travel as well as for home/office.UPDATE - After about 5 days of use, the charger appeared to stop working. I dropped my star rating (and have since bumped it back up again) and send an email expressing my displeasure with the apparent brief life span of the product.  There was an immediate reply with an apology and a new one arrived by FedEx two days later.This charger is still fairly new, so I can't speak to the longevity of the device, but the customer service setup at TOZO is second to none. This device comes with a 1-year warranty - based on my early experience, seems likely TOZO will continue to stand behind the product.\\n\",\n",

I think of the W1 as thin but this practically doesn't register. It has 4 rubber feet on the bottom so when you plug it in with the supplied cable it still sits flat. Some wireless chargers have the connection so low to the surface where it will sit that the size of the connector on the cable can cause them to wobble. This one sits flat and sturdy.All my devices work perfectly on it including my Samsung S9+ which consistently sees it as a Fast Charger. I'm using the Samsung charger that can with one of our phones. I seem to have a collection of those too!The only other thing I can mention is the power light. It shows green when it is ready to charge but not charging. It shows blue when charging. It's a little light on one end instead of the ring of light on the W1.I looked at some of the low rated reviews. I have not had any issues with the phone detecting it as a non-fast charger.

Not be be deterred, I decided that free one was probably not as powerful as one I actually paid for, so after doing some reading of existing reviews and obsessing over the specs of how far the device could reach (8mm in this case), I decided on the TOZO W1.Three days later, the charger was sitting on my doorstep and after unboxing it, plugging it in and nesting it in the cool little wooden home I created for it - SUCCESS!

       "  '\\nMy Review for TOZO \"puck\" style wireles charger. Bought this for use with my Samsung note 10+ so I can charge wirelessly. Would buy it again in a heartbeat.If you do your research you know that different chargers charge at different speeds. This is especially important for choosing the right wireless style chargers. You need to know what you are looking for and how to get the correct functionality. In addition to this you have to have a device (phone im my case) that can take advantage of its fast charge speed, some phones can\\'t. Also you have to have your own charge adapeter \\'block\\' that plugs into the wall that is rated for the higer wattage and amps required for the fast charge speed.So, it gets 5 stars for being exactly what it says it is, and doing exactly what it advertized. I do know that Samsung has come out with a super fast charger but its very expensive as of the time I am writing this review. So, do you research and you know hwat your buying.My small rant: It bugs me when reviewers down rate items either becasue of incorect expectations or because of comments on how it could have been better, when they should have know before buying an item. Sure its Ok to comment on other features you\\'d like or want. But make that part of you review informational (not critical and down-rating) to help other shoppers as they learn and search.I used my plug and usb c cable from my note 10+.\\n',\n",

Yikes! Why didn't we even consider looking somewhere else first) We didn't want to pay that again, but when I saw this on Amazon, I couldn't pass it up. It's beautiful, which is nice that it isn't an eye sore on my table. It works well, surprisingly well. Both my husband and I were shocked at how fast our iPhones charged. Not to mention, its a great value. You can't beat it. We plan to by another one.We always have phone chargers in our living room to charge our phones during the day and also for our guests to be able to use if they need. We both have iPhones but not all of our friends and family do, so this is nice that it works for any phone that is capable of wireless charging.Make sure your phone is CAPABLE of wireless charging before making this purchase. Many phones are not capable.We love this and would definitely recommend it!\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI have a Bold N1. Bought 2 of these when my USB charging port went bad and I wasn't going to pay to fix a $199 phone. It arrived on time we'll packaged. These look very nice and work as they should. I really do like the circular light ring that changes color to let you know it senses the phone and is charging. Don't listen to the reviews complaining about slow charging times. These people don't realize that there is a limit to how quickly you can charge a phone by placing it in a magnetic field, and cannot charge as quickly as a high end wall charger. If it did the coil in your phone that converts this field into current would get way too hot. Also you must provide the wall adapter, and the USB type C cable is included. Make sure to use a high quality wall adapter rated at at least the power output required or the charging will be much slower  (no $5 gas station or much older wall plugs because they don't provide enough juice to charge at optimal rates).My phone has a 3000 mah battery. It will charge from 10% to 100% in a little over a hour. Hope this helps!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nLove this charger to just lay my phone on and charge without having to plug in.  Had to order different cord for it to fast charge that only thing wish it came with.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAll reviews are accurate, the light does stay on while charging (not an issue for me as I use during day). The charger is quick charging for iPhone not tested on pixel \"yet\". Does not get real warm when charging which is great and a concern I had when buying. I have had this for a few weeks no issues however I always unplug when not in use.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nThe setup was simple, but connecting the charging cable to wireless charger presented an issue... When inserting the USB charging cable into the wireless charger port there was resistance to push the charging cable all the way into the port. When I pushed it all the way down in the port the LED indicator light blinked repeatedly, which the product guide doesn't define what this means. I assumed to not push the cable all the way down into the port, but to stop inserting into port where resistance begins, which stopped the LED indicator from repeatedly blinking a green light to a still green light. My earbuds/charging case and phone was able to be charged. At any rate, the wireless charger doesn't seem to fast charge my phone as it is suppose to. Emphasis on doesn't seem. My observation could be incorrect. Perhaps, I was just impatient. Overall, I do favor the product.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI thought this would be a fast way to set my phone down without having to fuss with a cable. Instead, this device requires an equal fuss when setting the phone down on it. You have to put the phone down on the charger carefully without touching the charger itself with your fingers or you risk electrical shock and the charger shuts off. I thought it was a one time occurrence but keeps happening, especially on low-humidity days when I'm afraid to use this thing.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI like the fact that you dont have to plug in your cell phone but i dont know how long it takes to charge.  its a good little charger that doesnt take space on your table.  the cord could be longer.\\n',\n",

Also, it makes it easy to stick in my purse & use it in my car when I\\'m on long trips. I took a chance buying, but it does work perfectly with my Apple IPhone SE & my earbuds too-winner!  Tozo always thinks of everything: they even included a \"cord keeper\" that helps keep any extra cord out of the way using a little velcro strap, and they have included a USB C to USB A adapter for greater versatility.  I did go ahead & purchase their USB C Power Adapter because I read it helps speed up the power supply.  What I LOVE is the 1 year warranty that is included - so I feel safe knowing if I have a problem, I\\'m covered for awhile.  This company has terrific customer service, I highly recommend any Tozo product.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nSo far this charger has been great! No big problems  or issues. The only thing I would say are small hiccups are that it doesn’t charge super duper fast (so if your phone dies and you’re looking for a quick recharge, I wouldn’t use this I would use something faster). The other thing I’d say is that sometimes if it’s not lined up correctly with your phone it might not charge (I woke up once or twice to my phone battery at like 30% because I thought it was charging). Other than that, it’s been super portable and it’s sleek design is really nice! If you don’t like lights shining in your room at night make sure your phone covers them on the charger before you sleep (you can’t change the brightness on the charger).\\n',\n",

It may have shorted the tiny iPhone adapter that I had lying around, which I replaced with a better adapter and it's been working trouble free since.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThis seems to work okay, but the EMF field (radiofrequency signal) is stronger than my wireless router and could cause some interference (plus it's probably not great for your health if you're in close proximity).  The signal was very strong even 30 feet away which can affect sleep according to studies, so I would definitely not have it plugged in by a bed to charge at night.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI love the thinness of this charger and the LED lights that let you know its working.  It is a bit finicky when it comes to placing the phone on the charger.

Best bargain on the planet!\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nI bought this for my Samsung S22 because it claimed to be fast charging. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I tried 4 different fast charging adapters, both QC 2.0 and 3.0 and ended up with the same result.  It will say fast charging for a second, then switch to standard charging. This really didn't bother me until I had about 15% battery left and my phone said it would take 3 hours to charge.As far as the looks of this wireless charger goes, it's beautiful! It looks lovely on my nightstand, and is perfect for travel. I also really like the light cues so you can tell when it's charging. The lights aren't bright at all, which is great if you can't sleep with light in your room. If you don't care about fast charging, then I definitely recommend this. However It's a deal breaker for me that it takes 3 hours to charge on really low battery.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nTOZO for the win!I have been reviewing TOZO products for around a year or so, they send me something and in return I give an honest review. This is the third charger I am reviewing for them and honestly, after the last review I thought they’d never use me again. It wasn’t good, but this charger changes things completely!First off, I’ve never been a huge fan of this type charger, you have to leave your phone alone and can’t use it while it’s charging and that does no good through the day, but this charger has magnetic ability that changes that. It will attach to your phone and let you play with your phone while it charges.Secondly, it charges my iPhone 11 Pro Max stupid fast! Easily as fast as my plug in charger.Lastly, it looks and feels great. This thing is solid and built for the long haul and on your desk or night stand it will look great!The bottom line, this charger hits all the buttons that the competition lacks. Half the price of Apple’s with all the quality and looks meriting a much higher price. Make your wallet happy, get this charger!TOZO for the win!\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nI just received this product today and I mostly bought it so that I could finally have a wireless charger for my iPhone 11. Upon placing the phone onto the charging pad, it took up to 10 seconds for me to find the right placement for my phone to sit onto the charger. And I am not even sure if it even charges my phone being that I had my phone on the charger for over 30 minutes and it stayed at 74%. As for charging my T12 headphones they worked perfectly well and charged relatively fast.On top of that, the product does not look exactly like the pictures from other consumers nor the pictures provided from the company. The box and other pictures shows that there are two curved LED lights on the top, but my product came with one small, tiny circle LED light on the side of the charging pad.Due to these features and lack thereof I am returning the product.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI found this really sleek and elegant, but had a few reasons that I won't use it as often as I'd like.Pros:- easy to fast charge- immediate charging- Nice and compact- easy to find a place to put it- looks niceCons:- Would not charge through my phone cover, so I have to remove it to charge- After a while of charging my phone slides off the charger even on a flat surface- to get a full charge I need to check it and make sure it remains on the chargerEDIT: I was able to get it to stay on the charger so now I use it and it fast charges well, but I must remove my phone cover. Apparently my shelf was not level. I pulled out a level and discovered this, so I moved it to a level place and it worked.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nI just got this charger a couple of weeks ago. It works fine and is a really nice looking item. It looks just as good as the pictures. You can place this anywhere in your home. I don't normally give an item 5 stars after using it just a couple of weeks, but this is such a great value that I made an exception in this case.It charges fine, but I only gave 4 stars for charging power because I have not made the time to note how long it takes to charge a phone fully. I know charging time is something that is very important to some people (not me) so I was hesitant to give 5 stars. It just works.I suppose this would work just fine for travel, but I use a regular wired connection when I am traveling, hence the 3 stars for travel.Finally, in the interest of full disclosure, the vendor contacted me after I registered the charger and told me they would send me a free one if I wrote a review. I would never write a misleading review just to receive a free item--in fact, the opposite is true: I would have written a scathing review if I thought this was a poor product and the seller had made such a request. And, I would not care if they sent me another if I were dissatisfied with the item in the first place. I am not receiving monetary compensation for this review. Now you know, and you can make of this review what you will.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI got this charger as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It DOES come w a charging cable, but you need to plug into your own charging cube.  I thought it was sleek, and would be accessible for anyone to use, as my husband has a small “desk area” set up in part of the kitchen. I didn’t realize just hOW convenient it would be!!! As your phone is just lying on the pad, it is so much easier to pick it up to make/answer a call, etc, without having to unplug the phone!  We liked it so much that we got 4 more: one for each of our nightstands, one for my husband’s workshop, and one that I bring with me, if I travel to my Mom’s.  It is sturdy, sleek and attractive. I saw a review that highlighted the lights on the glass disc. They are terrific (let you know when your phone is completely charged), but they don’t cause sleep disturbance: Just turn the phone so that the lights lie under the phone when you are charging your phone overnight.  Great price for a quality product.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThis is a very nice quality wireless charging pad, I bought the silver with the grey silicone top.  Out of the box you can see that this is well built all aluminum except the silicone pad and has some heft to it.  It measures 4 inches in diameter and has a small single LED indicator at the front that emits green while plugged ready to go and blue while it charges.  I chose this particular unit due to it having the grippy top and the smaller LED footprint, I didn't want the light show or have my iPhone slip off the pad.  Regarding the LED it's a pretty bright green for a single emitter I couldn't have this sitting on my nightstand next to my bed, but I prefer pitch darkness while I sleep YMMV.  The blue light while it's charging is definitely more tolerable though.  Although I can't comment on its fast charging capabilities, I use a standard 5w brick, it charges just as fast as using a cable with the same adapter.  My preference is to use this with the 5w adapter just to cut down on heat and possibly extend the battery cycles.  I don't need fast charging capabilities for my needs, but I guess it's nice to have it available in case my needs change I just can't review that part of the device.All in all I am very happy with this unit and have been using it daily for close to a month now without issue. I would definitely purchase another TOZO if another was needed.\\n\",\n",

Using with a Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus 5G inside a case and it charges the same in or out of the case.  Does not fast charge nor super fast charge my S20 but that is fine for me since it's on a bed side table for overnight charging.  I like the LEDs on top that light green in standby and change to blue during charging.  It's small flat size will make it easy to pack in any bag and take with me on trips versus my Samsung standup version that doesn't fold closed.  It's a little touchy about the phone position and will indicate charging while the phone is not being charged, just make sure your charging indicator on your phone says it's charging before leaving it alone to charge.  Probably buying another for my wife.  So far, I would recommend it to friends.\\n\",\n",

Nice here are the rubber feet so it doesn't slide.  A few negatives and why it only got 4 stars... when it's plugged in and not charging there is a soft green light on. If you use it at night might bother some people. It comes with the cord but not the adapter to plug into the wall. Granted, if you're like me I have adapters crawling out the drawers, but if you don't and are looking to put this in an extra area, won't work. But my biggest complaint is that it really isn't a quick charge for what I'm use to. It sits in the middle. I'm use to 60 minutes from dead to full... this is about 90 to 120. It's OK, but not what I was hoping for, but for 10 bucks I can't really complain.\\n\",\n",

This charger was definitely worth the pennies it cost; whereas my last charger was very sensitive for where on the pad you had to place it, this smooth large surface is much better about charging area. Also the smooth surface is both nice and overall very aesthetically pleasing (and a pretty solid build). Huge plus is this runs on USB-C unlike many wireless chargers still on the market, and this has a good charging speed (haven't done precise measurements, but significantly faster than the last one I had).\\n\",\n",

This is the first wireless charger that I bought, and it is awesome. I currently have an iPhone XR, and two pairs of Tozo Earbuds (Tozo T10 and Tozo T12), so I use this wireless charger to charge all of these. I love how the wireless charger is so thin, shiny, elegant, and portable! The charging power is fantastic because all my devices charge so quickly and efficiently. There is a green LED light when the wireless charger is plugged in, and then it turns blue when it is charging something, so that is a great way for me to make sure that my device is charging. The USB cable is nice and 3 ft long, so I can plug it in from a distance, and there are four rubbery feet that give an exceptionally good grip on any surface. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless charger that has a great charge time, efficiency, and a fantastic outer appearance. Getting these many great features and such great satisfaction is very rare, but I have definitely gotten it with the Tozo W3 Wireless Charger!\\n',\n",

I needed something that I have a small and slim profile, not too much of IT looking design, and be able to use my existing USB adaptors. TOZO W3 wireless charger met all my needs. 3.5 inches of diameter and thickness of 0.19 inches is small and thin enough to feel like the product is a built-in charger when it is placed on the desk.One useful tip that I found out. A small LED in the product will lit in green when the product is connected to a USB. If the LED blinks in green when a phone is placed on the charger, that means either the USB port is not compatible or your phone is not properly placed. If this happens, try to connect to a different USB port or slightly adjust the position of the phone. When the charger is working, the LED will lit in blue. When the charging completes, the LED will lit in solid green again. If you need a cost-performance wireless charger with an esthetic appeal, I believe this is the product you will love.\\n',\n",

My husband tired of waiting took it off the pad and plugged in the charging cable which took 2 hours to reach 100%!!  Charging is inconsistent with iphone 12 Pro Max.  From 79%  goes down to 75% in an hour.  It takes overnight  from 75% to 84%.I believe something is wrong with the charger, it is definitely not fast charging if it charges at all.  The blue light on the pad does go on, the green charging light does not always stay on the iphone, it goes off sometimes and adjustment is needed.I reach out TOZO customer service but not helpful back and forth 5 times insisting I get an AC adapter 5V / 2A I did use the original specialized USB cable(come with the charger) , didn’t use off brand cable and adapter. As TOZO indicated other cheap usb cable/ adapter may not provide sufficient voltage to the wireless charger.Sounds like my Apple original AC adapter not good enough. There’s nothing  indicated in the description that 5V / 2A AC adapter is required for it to work. I really wish it could work as there’re many good reviews but disappointed and frustrated. I will just return to end all the frustration.Update:I bought an AC adapter 5V/2.4V for this charging pad, the charging speed improved but still only 65% overnight. I shared the outcome with Customer service. They believe it should be faster than this and compensate with partial refund.  I added another star for positive customer service.\\n',\n",

I would much rather it had a built-in USB port (mini-USB or USB C) to plug into existing cables in my car, office, and on my living room coffee table. For me, plugging and unplugging cables at the power source is a major pain — especially in my car where I need needle-nose pliers to reach the USB ports.

I was surprised and very happy.-works with my airpods pro.-looks great-niceCONS:-charge rate is slower than charging via plug (tested on iPhone 8)-charge rate is also slower than other wireless chargers I've had (ie., Anker 10w charger)I'd recommend it for anyone that has devices they want charged without the extra cables. Aesthetically, the charger is glossy, with thin led lighting that's also functional (green=ON; blue=charging; blinking=not charging).I'm happy with it. I wished the charging was faster but as it sit in on my office desk, I'm ok with a slow charging if it means I don't have to have as many cords.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI originally bought this wireless charger for my son for a Christmas gift, turns out his phone does not support wireless charging. Totally my fault for not actually looking up his phone and just assuming. So I decided to save the hassle of going through the process of returning this item, and just use it for myself. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max, with a simple thin plastic case on it. I have gotten this wireless charger to work ONE time for a total of 15 min with my phone. It will not charge, I have even taken my case off just to see. Yet all I get is blinking lights and no charging feedback on my screen. Save your money and go with a better charger. This thing is junk.**Edit**The company reached out to me regarding my less than satisfactory experience with their product. They have wonderful customer support and if you have any troubles with their products they will go above and beyond to make things right for you. Awesome seller, just received a defective product in the beginning. All is well now!\\n',\n",

I've bought several different charging pads, and this one wins hands down.All the others required the phone (with case) be just right or either the phone would not start charging or, it would stop charging soon after it began. Not with this one. I don't know how they did it but, I can just plop it down kinda sorta in the middle and I hear the charging chime. It amazes me.  credit cards preventing it from working. I have my license and 2 cards in a smartish case and no problem.  Once you discover wireless charging it's a huge game changer.While in the dark bedroom you grab the phone to check on this or that, it's dark but there are some very cool lights that let you know where to lay it back down. They don't interfere with sleep and go out a few seconds after connected to the iPhone. Not sure why Apple hasn't promoted this feature more than they have. It seems charging is a never ending battle with smart phones. No longer. If you're in need of one buy this one!\\n\",\n",

I have 2 cell phones (one for work and one for me) and my ear buds that can be charged wireless. The problem is they all take different cords to charge them. Now I just set them down on this magical device and boom!! Charged phones and ear buds!! No more cords!! All my devices charge quickly and do not get hot like other wireless charges have done to them. I have both phones in Otterboxes and this charger has no issue with that.

It is my first use of wireless charging. I simply use the provided USB cable to connect to my laptop. My TOZO earbuds charging case, then can be placed on the charger as needed. The first time I used it, the charging case was about 85% charged and it only took a few minutes for it be fully charged. It looks great and the lights on the charger will show if it charging. I placed an old Samsung phone on it and as expected, the phone does not support wireless charging, which was confirmed by the lights on the charger. It does not come with an AC adaptor, but that is not a problem for me since I am plugging it into my laptop and I have to many adaptors already in the house. Very happy with this purchase.\\n',\n",

The price is great and I really didn't want to have to order a new set.The charger comes in a slim box with no frills. Charger and cord. Pretty much all you need. The directions were simple and to the point. The only thing that doesn't come with it is the AC adapter. Not a big deal because I must have 10 of them in a drawer just like most of us do these days. The no adapter is actually something I like as it means the box is slim and easy to carry.As you can see from the picture the design is slim. I almost put my coffee cup on it because I thought it was a coaster for a minute.It easy to use. Plug in, either with adapter or into a usb port on your laptop or desktop and let it charge. I fully charged my earbuds in about an hour and a half.All in all I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone.

I will update this if it breaks but otherwise, it works for what it is intended to do.As a side note, the English that comes on the box is very bad.

So far I’ve connected the charger to a USB port in my wall and another USB port on an iHome dock/radio unit. It has worked just fine with both. There’s enough power to do the job. Since the phone rests on the pad overnight, the extra time it takes to fully charge my phone is a non- issue. Wireless charging takes more time than using a lightning cable, so if time is of the essence, I use a cable.

I was so impressed with this charger that I ordered 3 more for all my family to include my 5 year old. The lights on the top plate of the wireless charger are very easy to read for my toddler and even she knows now if the phone is placed correctly and charging or if it needs adjustment. Another big plus is the safety of my daughter not having to need to handle any wires to charge or disconnect our phones for her when she decides to jack up our data all day in the road (not that I let her plug in my phone but having to stop to attend my 5 year old is a demanding job especially if the phones dying).

I then used this wireless charger with that same chord that I got the fast charge with and it said it would complete the charge in an hour.

It was very simple to unbox and plug in. You plug it in just like you would a normal phone.Also, I dropped it right out of the box from about 3 feet, and it sustained no damage, so it is built well, too.The product is basically a really modern-looking, simple, clear glass plate, and it looks very trendy.When you place your phone on it, the green light turns blue, so you know it is charging. I highly recommend; you won't be disappointed. It charged my phone very quickly, too.\\n\",\n",

Just need to have the right USB hub.Biggest con is it randomly stops charging (too hot??) and also if you move it even slightly off center it disconnects. I feel like i have to babysit it. This charger is by absolutely no means a fast charger. Takes too long and is hit or miss. Last night i thought it was chagring (having checked it twice) but i woke up today and it stopped around 30 percent... it was BARELY off center. Too sensitive IMO. My friend has one that you just drop it anywhere on and it charges FAST. Maybe this is just a cheaper option.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nSlim and exuding beauty and quality, the Tozo Qi-compatible charger has performed to my expectation. It is a replacement for my pricier and ineffective Logitech Charging Stand ($140 retail) which would not charge my iPhone 10 XS in the vertical or horizontal position with my Elementcase-BO. The case is secured with 8 screws making removal of the case for wireless charging inconvenient and impractical.The Tozo charger is able to link-up with my thick (emphasis) case, provided you carefully place the phone into position and follow the visible blue light queue, that the coil has been detected, followed by the flashing green light (and lightning bolt on the phone\\'s battery indicator) to assure you that the battery is being charged. The indicator lights are beautifully arranges arcs around the outside of the charging surface making it highly visible and my ability to place the phone effortless after a day or two.Other IPhones used by my family have thinner cases. These link up with the charger much more easily. Based on my \"testing\", you will experience effortless usability right out of the box.First impressions, thick cases and wireless charging will require all manufacturers to up their game. This charger costs slightly more than 1/10th of the Logitech.  The Logitech is useless to me. The TOZO comes up the winner. Great job.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nI've recently jumped into the world of wireless charging after trying one out and seeing how convenient it really is.  So, I went looking around and found this one on a lightning deal with lots of great reviews.When I received it, I excited to set it up and had the perfect spot picked out for it.  When I pulled it out of the box I really liked the smoothness and shininess of it.  It looks really nice and isn't just a matte plastic top.  The indicator lights are small and simple and located just a little inside of the edge, which makes it great for using in your bedroom to charge while you sleep because the light isn't leaking out of the edges nor is it bright enough to light up the part of the room where it is sitting.  The lights are really easy to see when looking at it.  The other thing that I was surprised at was that it is USB C (I didn't read the details too closely when I purchased it).  If you ever travel with this you can just use the same cable in the car then bring it into wherever your staying to charge at night, or use the cable you already have (if your phone uses USB C) and connect it to this and not have to move anything around.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nOk, I was pretty skeptical that I'd get a decent charger for how inexpensive this is, but I own a pair of Tozo headphones so I figured I'd give these a shot. Bought 3 of them and they worked great, at first. A little after a month of owning them, one of them died. Lights won't come on when I plug it in and it doesn't charge anything. I contacted customer support and they said they'll send me a new one and that I don't need to worry about sending the old one back in. Great customer service, and the other two chargers work great, so I assume the third one was just a fluke.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI’ve been using this for a couple of months now so I’m reviewing some usage rather than just how it looks coming out of the box.The charging pad is super thin and unimposing.  It has rubber feet that keep it firmly in one place so it won’t slide around with movement of the cable.  The status LED is on one edge so you can see the status when your phone is charging.  The previous model had the LED on the top which of course gets covered.I’ve been charging both wireless earbuds and an iPhone.  Both seem to charge efficiently and I haven’t noticed any issues with speed of charging, not that I’m generally in any great hurry.  In any case slower charging is better for the battery than super fast charging.I would recommend this product based on my experience with it.\\n',\n",

I got 0.64A and 8.96V while using Macbook Pro USB-C charger, which converts to about 5.73 watts as is what is expected for charging an iPhone 11.  If this were an iPhone 12, I’d expect a lot higher, but I didn’t have one handy for the test.  This is enough to run my maps software, play some music and drive.  I tested quite a few bumps, and the mount held steady.  It is magnetic and works with my iPhone 11 magsafe case.  The back of the charger is also able to stick to my legacy magnetic phone mount, which upgraded it to MagSafe!  I didn’t need any other mount, which is a major plus!  Two birds with one stone.  This will work with a decent MagSafe case, so find yourself a case that works with your phone, and your golden!\\n',\n",

My biggest complaint is that this unit come with a very short cable and I have been unable to get it to work properly with ANY other USB C cable that I have. (I have tried multiple different cables of varying lengths and qualities) So, it seems that it will only work with the cable it comes with which is about 30\" long. The second complaint I have is that although it will charge my phone (very slowly, no fast charge) it will not recognize either of my earbud cases on the charger which are both Qi complaint and have no problems on my other wireless charger. So, in the end it is a pretty little unit and has a nice feel to it, but it\\'s just not all that functional (at least for me) and I would not recommend it.

It is so lightweight that it feels almost plasticky.2) price; for under $20, plus a discount, you can’t beat that!  That’s cheaper than an Apple Lightning cable!  It charges my iPhone and AirPod; what else do I need in a charger?  I don’t need it to be super fast because I usually charge things overnight.  Besides, quick charge adapters are extra cost, so they’re not worth it to me.Some people might not like the lights being on all the time.

After a few days of use, I see that it does not heat up either.I like the mirror finish and the Apple-like white and aluminum look.The packaging is nice, a seal of authentication and online product registration link.

The charger itself and the phone itself doesn't get hot. Removed the cover with the metal piece and no problem. Also, fast charging! Two hours for a full charge from less than 5%.

The moment my wife walked into our room, after I set two of these up, she just laughed and said there was no way they were staying in there.I considered breaking the LEDs, but figured Id rather just return them.The other downside is the smooth top, it is so sleek that any phone without a rubberized phone case just slides right off (even some that do have cases).

I was disappointed to discover that the silver color refers to just the thin rim around the edge of the unit. From the picture I thought the whole pad would be silver, but it is just white, which still looks fantastic. The light is green when on and blue when a device is placed on it. Without a phone or device covering the led indicators, it may be a bit bright for sensitive sleepers, but after my phone is placed, only a soft glow, virtually nonexistent, surrounds the base. The bases diameter is wide enough that I don't have to worry about my phone sliding off; a welcome feature versus my last charging pad.\\n\",\n",

If it is across the room from where you sleep it will probably be fine.The second issue I have is the lights on it. It lights up green when your phone is not on the charger, and it lights up blue when it is charging. It is a pretty bright light, and it could honestly be used as a night light lol.

I don’t trust the device to charge my phone and would never place it bedside to charge overnight because it might not charge.

       "  '\\nI would read this product a 3.7/5. And the reason why I rated it that is because it charges very slow for an iPhone. Like it took five hours for it to charge and it was on 80% and not only that but the charging cable is really short which can make it difficult if you put it on your dresser if it’s longer than 30 inches tall. I’m also going to mention that at the bottom it has grips for you put it down and it doesn’t slide which has been helpful. And if you have an iPhone and the case is on it won’t charge do the case you have to take the case off in order for it to be charged or else it’s gonna keep disconnecting from your phone.

Neither color is too bright to sleep beside. Also I’ve noticed that when I accidentally give it a static shock, apparently there’s an internal safety measure that resets the device as if I just plugged it in the wall.

I had one of these in my home office and I really liked it....it had worked with my previous phone but worked even better with my new phone.  So I ordered another.  With my smaller phone I had some issues with getting the phone placed in the right spot to charge but not with my new bigger android phone.  It starts charging right away and charges fast too.  I haven't traveled with it but I think it will be great for traveling.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI didn’t think I’d need a charger for my new iPhone 11, but the value for the convenience of this charger was well worth the investment. If you have wireless earbuds and are running out of battery, fear not. The phone easily remains charged while you sit and relax on your phone call wherever you like within Bluetooth distance. I no longer loose my phone, charger cords, or worry about frayed wires because it sits easily in a convenient location whenever it needs charging and I put it in plain sight. I haven’t lost my phone since I bought this charger. It’s sleek and takes up very little room. I looked at a lot of chargers, and though I’m partial to the futuristic aluminum color, it’s as if I don’t have to worry about my phone anymore when I’m in my house.\\n',\n",

It just a silicone top, which add some grip.It's not what I was expecting, but it's still a nice charger.  Feels like a quality build and so far is working fine.  I will probably end up keeping it to use for bedside charging since the only light it has is very tiny and subtle.  It's a light the size of a pen tip that shows green when not charging and blue when charging.I might order another in the glass top to use for my desk.This would be a really nice one for custom branding if they had that option to put a custom logo on the pad.\\n\",\n",

I must say that I am now quite satisfied with them and I will be making other purchases with them in the future! I had high hopes for this charger, but I was a little disappointed.  The charger is very slow and if your phone isn't placed just right, it won't charge at all.  If you don't need a fast charge, then this will work for you.  It looks very sleek and doesn't take away from my decor.\\n\",\n",

I believe that they did not have the correct wall charger with QC 2.0 or QC 3.0 capability. This charging pad states in the manual that a QC 2.0 or 3.0 is required for quick charging of either Android or IOS devices. You can see my Galaxy S8 phone states “Fast Charging Wirelessly” after the first attempted charging on this charging pad with a QC 3.0 enabled wall charger and using the factory supplied USB A to C cable. My phone charged at a rate of +20% in 28 minutes ( I timed it with a stop watch ).This is an excellent unit, at an affordable price.As with any technology device ... “operator error” is responsible for most issues.\\n',\n",

Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the new one they sent me was a black one when I ordered white.The product looks good but only works half the time and takes hours and four times as long as the cable to charge my phone.I wanted to use this to charge my phone overnight but I keep finding it only half charged I.

It's sleek design is barely noticeable on my bedside table & no more searching for cables to plug my phone in - I just set it on top & it automatically detects my device - it works great charging my TOZO earbuds as well.

Although, there is apparently a limit to the thickness of the case through which the pad can charge.The phone in the photos is a Samsung S7 and the button holds the phone 6mm from the surface of the pad.  The pad works fine in this situation.The last photo shows the iconography on the face of the wall charger being used to drive the pad.  Either of the ports in the charger works well and produces the same rate-of-charge from the pad.Final thoughts:  Nice looking charge pad that functions well and is easy to use.  Fine by me!\\n',\n",

I've had a couple other wireless chargers and if the phone wasnt in the exact spot it wouldnt charge, or wouldnt charge very fast.This is a simple, lightweight, very cool looking wireless charger that does exactly what its suppose to and at a really good speed. I've found a flat charger is the way to go no matter what you are charging as it is a lot more universal than the propped up charger so fiscally it's a better way to go. And for any amount of travel, now experiencing this I cant go back to Tetrising stuff. It's so sleek storing it for travel couldnt be easier, its thinner than a book. I couldnt be happier with it and at a respectable cost.\\n\",\n",

I then switched between multiple AC adapters, and that didn't make a difference. So, now am at square one working on a return.The company has sent a replacement very quickly though.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI just recently discovered the advantages and ease of using a wireless charger for my iPhone and purchased this Tozo charger. It works great - it's easy, convenient and quick. I would recommend it to anyone. One slight drawback is the charging cable has a regular sized USB end that fits into an adaptor (no problem) and the micro USB size that fits into the charger itself. I thought that would also be no problem and, in fact, figured I had plenty of other same sized cables. This wasn't the case, however, because the end that fits into the charger (and the opening in the charger) is a slightly different size than all my other cables. Not a problem as long as the cable that came with the charger keeps working and/or isn't lost. Other than that, the charger works great!\\n\",\n",

I’ve only owned one other Qi wireless charger and this product is very comparable to that one as far as the charge. Where this one surpasses my previous charger (for me personally) is it’s sleek, thin, space-conserving design, and it’s color change indicating charging vs. charged. I bought two of them. One sits on my desk and the other on my night stand. At first my wife and I were worried that the light would be too bright for a dark room while we were trying to fall asleep, but we find it to be no issue. I also appreciate the color change differentiating between charging and charged...I also use this charger for my Tozo wireless headphones, so product versatility is always a good thing. Bottom line: if you’re looking for a wireless charger that consumes very little space, delivers a reliable charge, and very clearly communicates charging vs. charged, then you’ve found your product.\\n',\n",

I have my phone in a thin silicone case and this provides just enough tackiness to keep the phone from sliding. Charging through the case is no problem.Mine does not have TOZO logo in the middle like the product image shows. Based on the description I didn't expect a cord, but there is a ~4 foot cord with USB-C on one end (plugs into the disc charger) and a traditional USB-A on the other end.

The case was on for like 20 min and got so hot that it burned her hand to the touch. I wanted to see if this was a thing, so I plugged that same case into a normal USB wire charger in another room and it never got hot at all.

       "  '\\nI love the size and the lights that are on the unit, but there is one issue.  The lights will change to charging, once the phone is placed on the pad, but it may not be charging the phone.  The pad is a lot larger than the last one I had, but the phone has to be centered to be charging.  Just make sure the phone says charging on it also, in addition to the lights changing different colors on the charging base.  Otherwise, great product!\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nAfter rearranging my office desk, I found myself placing my phone in the same place everyday, and decided it would be nice to be able to charge it while it sat there. I did some research on Amazon, and settled on this TOZO wireless charger. I liked the compact size and sleek design, and the claims of build quality. I'm not disappointed on any account. The unit is small but hefty, and the mirror finish and aluminum accents are visually pleasing. Charge performance is on par with other units I've used before, which is a good thing. If you're considering using this TOZO on your nightstand, please note that there are two green lights that remain on when the charger is empty, and which change to blue lights while the phone is charging. The lights are small enough and arranged in such a way that you can place your phone over them while charging and hide the lights completely if you prefer a dark room. Another plus is the inclusion of a USB-C cable, rather than the Micro-USB that some reviews mentioned. Overall a great charger at a fair price.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI bought this for my wife's I-phone 6S plus after it went in the bathtub and then wouldn't take the lightning cable plunge.  Saw 6s in the list but it wasn't for an i-phone.  I don't think any of these work for that phone.Keeping it for convenience as it works great with my iphone 11.Thought that I read that it worked without the cable once charged, but I don't think that's true.  Not much instructions with it.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWell packaged and quick shipment. Bought to replace an anklet wireless charger. The unit works wells, and is holds the power cord securely. The top portion is around a 1mm thick piece of aluminum. The one I purchase is black and has a mirror finish. It is attached to a plastic body with anti skid feet. It is very sturdy. I have used both an IPhone and Wireless Earbuds without any issues. Charging was fast. Their is a lighted indicator to let you know that it is working when you place a device on the unit. Overall, a solid unit that does what it is supposed to. Have tried to place change on the unit to see if it would overheat and it did not even turn on and must have the correct safety device. I would recommend this item and willPost an update after an extended use of the item. It comes with a 1 Year Warranty.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe TOZO W1 is a device that has style, performance, and solid construction.Hold it your hand, and feel the metallic heft, not plastic. The style and finish is in the standard of the best devices by Apple and Samsung.The charging works exactly as designed - drop the device needing charge on the top, and the lights start to pulse and indicate that the device is charging.It has a USB-C port, and can use a multiple volt/ampere power transformer (Wall Wart) at 5V 9V and 12V input, for devices faster than the base 5V current.Overall, I like the TOZO W1, and I can recommend it!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nOnly downside is I can\\'t use it with my metal ring style grip. (Causes it to heat up) Faster charging than my cords! Neat to set visitors phones on and have them go \"I didn\\'t even know my phone could DO that!\" 😁\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nIf you are like me and believe in thoughtful purchasing, you might have a list much like mine with boxes that need to be ticked before making that purchase. Basically, I don't like buying junk. Not only does it waste my time and money, its just more stuff to fill up the landfill. Why am I saying this on this wireless charger review? Because it is not junk. This charger is a quality product, that appears it will last me many years to come. The stylish design definitely helps! The functionality of this charger is simple; it charges your smart phone, AirPods, anything that can be charged wirelessly just by placing the electronic on top of the charger between the lighted guides. The lights change color based on ready, charging, and charged. If you are sensitive to light while sleeping, I'd recommend keeping this farther away from your bed as possible. The light is not obnoxious but for a sensitive sleeper, it might be intrusive. Overall, I really love this charger, and I hope to use it for a long time.\\n\",\n",

I have had much slower chargers.However, it's the wide base that really makes it shine. I don't have to ever fiddle with it to find the charging spot. I just set it down between the lights and it finds it every time.The lights are easy to see around the phone so I can easily see where to put it and the change of light color lets me know if it's still charging without picking up the phone (also sometimes let's me know it's on the charger right before my phone let's me know).As I said, not a fast charger, but I'm okay with that. I usually keep it in my home office so I have other things to do so my phone can take a little longer (not much longer, though, its not a slow charger!) in charging. And the ease of use makes the time a non issue anyway. I totally recommend.\\n\",\n",

Love the color because it matches my furniture and doesn’t take much space. The cable that comes with it was too short for me since there’s no power outlet where I place the charger at. I just got a longer cable so not an issue. The cable length is just standard size. It just doesn’t work for me where I’m placing the charger at.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nGreat charger with very high speed charging. I am using it with the new Apple 20 watt USB-C charging block. Only issue is that you need a cable with USb-C on both ends, to use with the Apple 20 watt charing block that has USB-C output. Had to order USB-c to USB-C for this to work, but after that it has fast charging. Also very sleek and think so not impposing setting on a surface. Bought 5 more after trying one.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nThis charger from Tozo is very effective at doing its job, whether that may be charging your phone or your earbud case. It is nice and small, therefore easy to find a place to put it, the adverse effects of this negated by the magnet. The charging speed is comparable to a wired charger, though not on the level of fast-charging by any means. However, the main reason I would recommend this is for ease of use and convenience, and it charges fairly efficiently compared to previous iterations of the wireless charger. The packaging was beautiful just like any of the other electronics from this company, and the design of the actual charger was quite sleek, conveniently coming with a USB to USB-c adapter.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nNote that this unit does NOT come with a USB cable and plug. But they are pointing this out in the description. This charger is very thin. It has an indicator light at the top that shows you if it is charging, \"kind of charging\" or finished charging. I am not quite sure how fast it is charging as I use it to charge the phone overnight. However, my Galaxy S10 never complains about slow charging so it seems to be alright. The only a little \"tricky\" think is putting the phone on the charger. It has to be somewhat precise or it doesn\\'t charge properly. I suspect that\\'s the case with other chargers as well (not sure, though) hence I am not taking any points off. All in all I am very satisfied with this charger.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nI recently bought my wife a Google Pixel 4 for her birthday and, since the Pixel 4 supports wireless charging, bought this charger to go with it since the charger lists that it is compatible with the Pixel series.  The product itself is very well made and worked great the first time we used it.  It charged almost as fast as the normal fast-charge cable that comes with the Pixel series and got her phone from about 20% to 90% in about 45 minutes.Unfortunately, after that first charge, it has not worked again.  We have had the charger for about 2 weeks now and tried the phone with and without case, facing in different directions (yes we know the coil has a specific orientation in order to work correctly), using different cables, plugging it into different outlets, etc.  The only other time I was able to get the phone to charge was after removing the case and turning the phone off, it charged for about 20% but otherwise stopped working.  The charger does seem to be recognizing the phone - when plugged in the lights are green and when the phone is sitting on it correctly oriented the lights are blue - but it is definitely not charging.I don't know if we just got a dud or what, but I had moderate hopes for this charger based on the overall high ratings and so far am disappointed with what we got.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI bought 4 of these to gift to my family members after reading all the amazing reviews. What I love most is it charges such a variety of phone cases. It truly is multifunctional. It charged it a popsocket (when placed in a certain position), an otterbox, and a leather folding phone case as well! For the price that it is, it looks quite expensive. Its so easy to use that even my 87 year old grandma is able to charge her phone by herself. Usually she has a problem telling whether her phone is charging or not but with the color change from green to blue, she loves it! I hope that the quality remains the same for a long time, I'll update this review if there are any problems.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nFirst things first - it wasn’t even close to the color displayed on Amazon (see picture). It is tan as opposed to the shiny orangish gold advertised. That was a huge surprise and disappointment. Beyond that... I like it. It matches my rug exactly which is actually better than if it had been the color I thought it was. It serves my purpose perfectly. I got it to keep my AirPod charger case charged and it’s great for that. It charged my phone very slowly, but I didn’t get it for that purpose so I’m okay with that.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUpdate (8/12/2020 - was delivered 6/30/2020 ): I purchased two of these, one in black and one in white/rose gold, and although the black one works (no issues), the white/rose gold doesn’t charge my phone at all. It just sits there and blinks but does not charge my phone. I’ve even tried charging my AirPods and it still doesn’t work. Not sure if it’s just a bad one in the bunch or if the color of the charger has to do with it being defective (probably unlikely). Highly disappointed.This product is thin, lightweight, beautiful, and sleekly designed! Super easy to use (just plug in, peel off the protective sticker, and it’s ready to charge) and also offers an extended 1-year warranty (make sure to register your product). I bought two (one in white/rose gold and another in space grey) to put in my office and my bedroom - great for the price!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIn the beginning it worked through a case. Now, you have to enter it just exactly and wait to hear your phone indicate it’s charging. And that might change when you walk away. Now, I take off the case and it’s the same, only charges when at a particular angle and sometimes have to tap it back and forth to find that angle. It charges incredibly slowly.I loved the idea of this to give the port a rest and stop dealing with wires and ports. Now, it’s still on my desk for when I’m sitting here, it can be there. But on our main area where the phone could get tapped, it is not useful.Maybe I have a lemon version, it looks very nice but I still can’t recommend it. It’s only been several weeks. I wonder when it will stop charging altogether?\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThis works really well if you don’t have a case on your phone. It will work with a case but takes a few tries to get the phone to start charging. I also had a few times where it stopped charging overnight, there’s nothing worse than having your phone 1/2 charged when starting your day. In defense of this product, the factory charger didn’t like my case either. Overall seems like a nice product\\n',\n",

It works, the lights are blue ... then a message pops up on my phone \"phone not compatible with fast charge, resuming at normal charging speed\". Then it shows that it\\'ll take like 6 hours to charge my phone 70%!!!??? Whaa?! Ummm I just spent $800 on this Android phone that just came out a year ago (got it on an amazing sale 🙂). There is no reason why my phone should not be compatible! Especially when the description point blank said it was. My phone settings were set correctly and I purchased the correct charging brick. This charging pad is just worthless. I guess that\\'s what I get for trying to be cheap. Now I\\'m stuck with two of these, because they are not worth the hassle of returning. Don\\'t be like me.

I wished there was a way to turn it off when the phone is not being charged -- this is in my bedroom and the light bothers me a little, at night (not a big deal is the phone is being charged, as it sits over the light). Aside from that, it's a great way to save your cables and the phone port itself, as there's no plugging and unplugging cables each time you charge your cell. I might be buying another one to leave somewhere else in the house.\\n\",\n",

Seems like the magnet should be stronger or have no magnet at all.Update: I contacted the manufacturer and explained the issue and they sent me a newer version that comes with the adapter.

The charger looks as good in person as in the photos, with the glass face, silver bezel, and solid plastic back. The charging indicator is sleek and the color change when charging is nice.This charger doesn't do 15W like the Yootech but for the 10W that my Pixel 4 XL can take, the charging amperage is just as good as the Yootech as measured with an app on the phone.But really for the $13 I paid for it, the build quality is really really good and the charging speed is exactly as advertised. Would recommend.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThis is a very attractive charger with a pleasing design, but it does have one issue for me that renders it effectively useless: the lights. They are quite bright, and unfortunately there's no way for them to turn off. This is a problem because I bought this charger for my bedroom and want it placed right next to my bed. There are some work arounds I suppose, such as putting masking tape over the lights, or positioning the phone in a very specific position to mostly cover up the lights (although if you want to check your phone over night, you get those bright lights shone directly into your eyes at 4 am), but these are all pretty inconvenient efforts for something that you don't want to have to worry about.If you want this charger for an office desk or living room, then its perfect. However, if its for a bedroom, I would stay away.\\n\",\n",

But as I get more devices that support it and am running out of places to plug them in, I figured I might as well give it a shot. I was already buying a pair of TOZO's wireless earbuds so I just picked up this wireless charger too. Simply put, it works. It's heavy enough that it doesn't slide around and is super easy to use. It took longer to get the box open than it did to set it up and start using it. Now I can charge things next to my bed and not have to worry about fumbling with cables while I'm half-asleep.\\n\",\n",

THere is an indicator light that turns on when charging (like most chargers do), the light on this particular model is quite small and for me hard to see. At night I think this is a nice feature as it is hardly noticeable and is no bother when sleeping, however during the day it is hard to tell that the charger is working because you have to really look for the tiny little blue light. I have only had it for a day but am so far quite pleased.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI really like my charger. The smooth surface is nice and its glossy appearance and lights make it nice to look at. It charges faster than my samsung surface charger. Only a couple of issues - it is small and I have to slide my iPhone 8 plus across the surface until I feel my phone vibrate indicating it is charging. It seems to have to be centered in just the right spot to charge - which is fine but it would be better if it were shaped to match my phone and / or was magnetic so that my phone just snaps into place and charges. The other issue is that because it is so smooth, my phone slides off of it if not perfectly level - this is where a magnetic charger would come in handy. Aside from that, I love it and have bought the product twice. Once for home and one that I keep on my desk at work. The price is excellent!\\n',\n",

The charging case for the earbuds USB to Micro USB port on the house casing broke and would no longer charge. Thus, I figured I would buy the wireless charger to fix the charging issue and the wireless charger was indeed the solution to fix this issue for me.  I am satisfied that the TOZO wireless charger does indeed charge the TOZO T10earbuds! Also, please remember to activate your extended warranty for your products. Lesson learned LOL. Take care and be blessed y’all.\\n',\n",

I generally don't like wireless chargers, since most do not charge as fast as wired, however this fast wireless charger can charge your phone just as fast. Just plug it in to the current charger you currently use and make sure you change the cable from your AC adapter to the included in box Micro USB cable.Some reviews mention, this isn't fast wireless charging, they're wrong. They're not using the correct adapter, just look at the picture that has my Galaxy S8, says fast charging, and it charges just as fast as it would be plugged in.The design is very sleek and smooth, I love the color changing led lights, it lights green when ready, and blue while charging, it's not obtrusive at night, and can even been seen under the charging plate which I think is awesome.Overall, this is a must buy for anyone with a compatible smartphone, it's very convenient to just plop your phone on and go on about your business.\\n\",\n",

I was warned that these wireless chargers were slow to charge.  That might be the case, but I really have not noticed this.

I sometimes am on my phone at night until I’m so tired I barely can remember to plug my phone in before falling asleep. So this way, I can just set my phone on the charger and not worry that my phone will die over night!\\n',\n",

There are definitely mixed reviews for many products but I can assure you that this product is worth the investment.

They recommend using the ( specialized ) supplied usb power cord but it's only 3feet and doesn't get from the power strip under my table to the top!  Cant they be up front about what type of usb plug the charger takes! Maybe that's good since you should only use their supplied cable. And why not be up front about the voltage and amperage they recommend for the power supply!  Why should I have to dig and scan for something that important. If you can get over that its nice looking but is a finger print magnet though I don't imagine that should be much of a problem unless you intend on carrying it around.\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nI have been using TOZO blutooth wireless headphones for a few weeks and they have been impressive in their build quality and sound. When the opportunity arose to get a wireless charger to charge the headphone case, it was a no- brainer. The wireless charger takes 10 seconds to install and comes with the charger and USB-C cable. The form factor is extra slim and the base of the charger has a nice mirror finish. The case is metal and provides a solid stable base to accommodate any devices that need wireless charging. Charging speed is great as well. The base has a green light and then turns to blue when charging. The USB plug was a little loose and on emailing the seller and letting them know, without hesitation they said they would send a replacement for free to and to keep the original charger. This is how all sellers should treat their customers, ensuring the customer is taken care of without question. I highly recommend this charger and also the seller. Tozo rocks!\\n',\n",

However, the customer service was incredible and solved my issue the same day with a few quick chats!

The iPhone 12 pro max is large and I noted you have to make sure it’s positioned in the center of the plate before the charge will connect. Didn’t seem to be that way with the iPhone X so I’m thinking it’s just because of how big the 12 pro max is. So far so good. Will update this review if I notice any concerns.I like that it’s small enough to throw in a bag when traveling. And it won’t take up much space on my night stand. Very affordable too.\\n',\n",

I use it to charge my TOZO earbud base, as seen in the picture. I also use the charger to charge an Android phone with a very thick (4 credit card) case and new iPhone (one at a time, of course). It has no problem quickly charging anything that can wirelessly charge that I've tried so far.I use the included USB cable with an electrical outlet USB transformer as well as directly from my laptop USB port, depending on my needs. The wireless charger works equally well from either power source.\\n\",\n",

I'm forced to assume that what's happening is the charger will charge my phone until I hit 35%, then my phone will feed back into the charger in a loop non-stop, constantly keeping it at 35% battery.

The color is similar to Apple’s “space gray.” Even though I was expecting more of a silver gray, this still matches my desk aesthetic, which is a white/gray theme.The top is also textured to prevent your phone from sliding around. This helps if you have your phone on vibrate.There is a small singular light on the front side (not the top) of the charger indicating when it’s on standby (green) or charging (blue). It is easily covered up if the light bothers you at night.Overall, great wireless charger!

I pop the phone out of my case, and set it on the pad.  The phone charges very quickly - and I love it!  The only trick I had to figure out was that the pad turns blue when charging and flashes green when it's asking you to get the placement right for charging.

Not a huge deal if you have extras, but a bit inconvenient. The charging speed is fine, there isn't a noticeable difference from my old cord charger to this. The major drawback for me is that it's very fussy about where the phone is placed on the pad. The phone has to be sitting at the right spot or it won't charge. Nudging it a bit can make it stop charging. A couple times I woke up to a phone at less than 50% battery in the morning because of this.

I notice once the phone is picked up off of the charger, I see the current to the charger, bounce back and forth every few seconds between zero and a few milliamps of current.. flk k\\n\",\n",

Why any brand would make a permanent feature like this is absolutely beyond me as, for me, it ruins the product since I have it by my bed and it's simply too bright at night and is very annoying.  I hate that I have to buy another brand now as there is absolutely nothing wrong with this item sans that but for me, and I assume others, that's a deal breaker.  I should have read more reviews but I never even thought this would be a permanent feature on anything like this.  So buyer be warned....if constant green lights that you can't turn off are an issue for you then this is NOT what you want to buy unfortunately.\\n\",\n",

Once charged, don’t have to leave your device on there. I really like them for my workspace since it frees up more part of my desk. My first one has lasted me over 2 years and is still working.

It has lights to assist with that: green for stand-by, blue when the phone is 'charging'. But even when the blue light has been on all night, the phone will have typically will hold only a fraction of its capacity (although I have managed to find that sweet spot a few times to get a 100% charge).It would be a mistake to think that this has any more power than any other charger. It all depends on the wall plug that you connect it to (not included). Mine is 40 Watts, which will charge my phone via cable in 30 minutes. As far as I can tell this device only pulls 15 Watts so that even when you have a good wireless connection it takes a loooong time to charge. They all work the same way.To be honest, I've had this problem with every wireless charger I've ever had so it's not unique to this device.

The included cable is on the short side - only about 39 inches, but I had other cables I could use. The only other consideration is that it is always lit up, though it is is not overly bright.

It always starts charging instantly. In contrast, with each of the different model iPhones I 've owned previously, I would gradually get a lint build up in the charging port that was very hard to clean out and made charging harder and harder over time.

The phones I charge on the plates did not come with a wireless charging capability - I added an adapter that plugs into the USB-C port and is sandwiched between the phone and the phone cover.

First I know it is plugged in because there two green lights on all the time. Unfortunately I have placed my phone on a wireless charger that was not connected in, in the past.

This TOZO charger works great with my case on. I also have one of those removable popwallets that snaps onto a plastic base stuck to my phone case, so I end up with my case + an extra plastic piece when I want to charge my phone, and it still charges great with no issues.

Upon first using it, I immediately noticed that it's quite sensitive and my phone needs to be placed directly in the middle, and won't charge if it's off-center at all. However, it's easy to tell when it's connected because the light is green when the pad is plugged in but changes to blue when charging the phone. Charging power seems a little slow, because my phone estimates 3 hours to go from 60% up to a full charge, I'm not sure whether that's a fault of the product or something to do with my phone, but I mostly charge my phone while I sleep so I don't mind if it takes a few hours.Overall, good quality for such a cheap price.

The charger is almost paper thin pulled it out. The selling company has it secured to prevent any cracks. The charger has a glass like paper feel to it. Be careful... it does not come with an adapter, it only came with a type usb-a cable. I found using a low 5w adapter takes awhile for my iPhone to charge. I used a Qi adapter at 29 watts and charged pretty well, but this worked for me. I read to use a 11 to 13 watt adapter. The phone was warm but not hot. It works well with or without a iPhone cover.

Love this charger now and the convenience of being able to put your phone on it and charge it perfectly. Worth a shot! You’ll love it and in case you don’t, they stand behind their products!—[INITIAL REVIEW]Sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t... quite disappointed because lately it seems to not work more than it does work. At most, it turns blue and stays charging for 30 seconds before flashing green or stop charging completely. Quite inconvenient when you need to leave the house and then realize your phone is close to running out of battery. Would return but already past return window.\\n',\n",

It’s very similar to this product except for the following differences:1) no huge lights on top2) has a rubberized/textured top that prevents phone from moving when it vibrates3) uses a USB-C cable instead of micro USBNeedless to say, I bought the one without the light and I’m even happier with that.Original:The wireless charging pad is a lot thinner than expected and it looks very sleek. The quality looks expensive as well.It is constantly lit up blue to indicate it’s on standby and when charging a product, it lights up green. The lights are too bright in a dark room when a phone isn’t on top of it.This doesn’t require your phone to be in an exact spot like some other chargers.It looks great and functions great as well!\\n',\n",

My Apple watch did not charge on this.When it is plugged in there’s a green LED light showing that it is ready. When you put something on it that it doesn’t recognize, the green light will blink and when you put something on it that can be charged, the green light will turn blue.\\n',\n",

It works with my wife's, so I don't get it.\\n\",\n",

It has 2 LED lights that DO NOT turn off, keep that in mind when you're planning in having these in dark bedrooms. It also requires your phone to be in an exact position to charge, otherwise it simply won't. I've had morning where I thought I placed it charging but it was askew and didn't charge at all.\\n\",\n",

The cable has a Velcro strap attached to it— something not many companies include…Nice little touch. Also, with companies like Apple transitioning from USB charging cubes to USB-C charging cubes, it’s nice that Tozo included an adapter so you can use this wireless charger with either. It charges devices quick. For the quality, the lower price, as well as the little touches they’ve included that other companies don’t include— I think it was money well spent and definitely recommend!\\n',\n",

The charging lights on the side are very useful and actually visible when conspired to other products. However, the lights never turn off even if no device is sitting on the charger if that would be an issue for anyone. It charges through my phone case, is quite thin, and fits in a pocket in my briefcase if I need to carry it around. Overall, this is a great product. I have 5 stars to everything except for 4 stars in the charging field only because I have not yet tried out the fast charging with a third party fast charging adapter yet. The charger only came with a 3-4 feet charging cable and not a charger. In the future I would like to see the option to bundles purchase with the fast charging adaptor and possible longer charging cables.\\n',\n",

I opted for the matte version because the charging light is much more subtle than on the other version. The matte finish also helps to keep my phone in place, and the charger itself stays in place pretty well too. Being able to just set my phone down now when I go to sleep is so much more convenient than having to rummage around for a cord. And the charger is super thin (even thinner than expected) so it doesn’t take up much visual space, which is great!\\n',\n",

I searched through many chargers and this was the one that caught my eye. The design on this charger is gorgeous, I love how slim and sleek it is and the different colored LED lights that indict charging/not charging is brilliant. Only reason I deducted a star was because it doesn't charge as fast as I would like, takes about 30 minutes to reach 50%, but that could just be my phone.

In my experience, all wireless charging is much slower than wired charging. Also the lights are a little bright while I'm trying to sleep. I usually just flip over my phone and the charging pad on top of it so they don't keep me awake.\\n\",\n",

I haven't dropped it, or spilled any liquid on it, so I can't say how sensitive it is to those things, but I would think it fairs similar as other brandssince it seems like solid construction.  It also has 4 attached little rubber feet that keep it level, stable, and from slipping around.  I recommend it, and would get it again.\\n\",\n",

For the W3, the green light on the side of the charge will change from a solid green to blinking green when it is charging.  For a Dad with teenage kids this charger is a hit because it is “cool” for charging phones and their wireless earbuds.\\n',\n",

Not only does this charge quickly (7.5w), but what really won me over is that it’s able to charge my phone WITH my popsocket on! I was afraid I’d have to take it off every time I needed to charge my phone, but nope! A lot of the ones here on amazon state that they are unable to charge your phone with a metal case, a popsocket, etc. No worries with this one :) Bought two already. Totally worth it.\\n',\n",

There is a manual, but the wireless charger is for the most part plug & play - really straight forward.  The website clearly identifies that there is no AC Adapter provided with the purchase, but if you're like me you have a bunch of these sitting around your house - if not, they are cheap.BTW:  One thing that really surprised me was the included 1 Yr warranty registration card that was included...

You won't have trouble with having to shielding your eyes at night or plastering tape or sticky-notes over the lights so you aren't blinded through your eyelids like some chargers out there.The charger also works perfectly with the new Airpods as well as my iPhone X with a slim charging case. I don't have an Otterbox or the like so I can't comment on power penetration through larger cases, but I've had no negative experience so far.Charger only comes with the base and USB cable so you'll have to use your own or purchase an AC/USB-A charger block adapter.\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nPurchased this wireless charger for my nightstand and it works just fine. I had a small issue when I put my 8plus on the charger while listening to a podcast and fell asleep. By morning the charger had turned itself off most likely due to overheating. Would not recommend charging phone while it’s in use. After unplugging charger and allowing it to cool, it’s working fine again after plugging back in. I like the sleek look and charging lights. Green for charger being on and ready, blue for phone being charged. It’s not the fastest charger but my phone is at 100% by morning. I prefer this over continually plugging and unplugging the phone. May purchase a second one for the family room as well. Works fine with the standard iPhone outlet charger.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe green light turns blue when charging which is nice because normally we charge our phones overnight and the blue color is less bright. However you can position your phone to block all the lights. I have a 12mini so it feels like it has to be placed directly in the perfect spot for the wireless to take effect. I gave it a 4/5 for charge power because the phone definitely charges faster wired, but this wireless charger certainly does work!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nSo lets be honest it's a wireless charger. Not much to get super stoked about but this charger looks very very nice.The aluminum bottom feels expensive and the glass top is very nice as well. I went with the white one and man does it look great I have it sitting on my computer desk on my massive mouse pad. It actually makes my setup look better.Only thing i'll say is because the top is glass the phones slide really easily but everything else is well made.. Oh also the USB-C cable they provide is not the best. Works but not amazing.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI am so happy that I got to purchase this product, at the beginning I feel a little unsure of buying it since the price is so low that it made me doubt of the quality.  I can say that I was totally wrong, I feel ile this is the best investment of my life lol!!! The item is so good, that it charges my phone in a decent time frame, it is elegant and so functional. My parents al also taking advantage of it since it is compatible with android as well so I'm thinking to get 2 more for them as well. I can say this is a win to me and I fully recomend it to other people. It is making my life way easier than before!!!!!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nSo, recently my charger broke inside of my phone and I’d honestly drop the brand of it if I knew it just to let you guys know not to get it because it happened to my brother too, both around the same time and with no sign of it even being damaged. But anyways, I obviously need to be able to charge my phone, so I decided to get a wireless charger until I can remove the broken piece from my charging port. This one is amazing. It’s light, small, and sleek. It charges rather fast and doesn’t cause my phone to overheat or seem overwhelmed. Definitely a good purchase.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI just upgraded from my ancient 6s to an iphone 11.  This charger is the bee's knees!  So nice to just place your phone on top of it and it just charges it through induction.  I like the Otter Defender cases and the rubber seal they use over the charging port makes it a pain to plug the phones into the charger.  This solves that problem!  It also charges just fine through the thick plastic and rubber of the otter box.  Impressive!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI love this charger I leave it at my desk so it makes it super convenient to just set my phone down while I sit to do some work. The charger lights up green when its plugged in letting you know its on. The light then turns blue once you set your phone down to charge. I have also noticed that once my phone is at 100 percent it stops charging my phone on its own. It is not a fast charger so it will charge your phone at the same pace a regular charger would charge your phone.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI am pleased with this product as I have been using it for a week now with no issues. The lighting feature on the pad is nice letting me know it ready with a green light and purple indicating that the devices is inline with the charging pad properly and is being charged. I tested my Samsung Note 8 with different cases to determine interference with the connection for charging, Otter Box and any other cases that are thick will not allow for a charge connection. Though this goes for all charging pads. Best to have a light weight case or no case at all. I do enjoy the fact that I do not have to worry about cable connections with this charging pad. Yes, it is has charging. The same amount of fast charging you get when you connect your original fast charging cable that came with your phone. So far I am happy with this device.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIt works well. Charge fast\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI got it in blue to match my iPhone 12 Pro Max in Pacific Blue that's in the mail. I thought I'd prefer if the top to be blue as well but, honestly, the grippy surface is much better. I charged an iPhone X on it and worried that it would shift too much to charge regularly but the grip offered by the surface helped a lot! It is also subtly sparkly which is nice. I think charging it with DND on would be the best way to avoid shifts but it was less of a problem than I had anticipated. I am so looking forward to using this with my new phone!\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nVery nice looking charger. Easy to use. Before this, I was fiddling in the dark to plug in the lightning cable before I go to bed and was afraid that I might damage the phone INTU connector. But now all I have to do is to place the phone on the device. Nice it has the green light to place the phone correctly. Very reasonably priced. I saw them at Costco the other day amd they are much more expensive there. I think I will get one for my wide also. Highly recommend.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFast, portable for travel, light weight, works great\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI got a new Samsung S20 5G.  When I plugged in the wireless charger using the Samsung power supply and cable nothing happened.  Plugged that supply and cable into the phone and it works.  Hmm.  I still had the power supply and cable for the my previous Pixel 2 XL.  Tried that, and it works well.  Not sure if there is some tolerance out of wack with the Samsung connector, but the google one works so I am happy.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI was not expecting such a sleek looking product. This thing looks so nice and so far has worked just like it said it would. It’s thin but very sturdy feeling. I would recommend this to anyone who asks. The price point is amazing too! The only thing is it doesn’t come with the wall adapter but if you’re like me you have a million lying around the house so it wasn’t a deal breaker for me. I can use this for my iPhone, AirPods, and watch. My husband uses galaxy and it also worked for that too.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nIt's a very good deal, i like the color and design, y too thin, and faster, i like too much\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI wish there was more instructions provided with the item. I had to go to the Amazon reviews to figure out if the lights would be different colors or how I would know if it’s charging. You do have to charge It before you can use it. It does a great job though. Flashes green when it needs to charge, blue when it is charging the phone. Solid green when it’s charging.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nPlug it in and it's ready to use.  I was impressed that it charged my iphone with a soft silicone case without any problem.  Charging speed is slower than my Apple plug in charger but still acceptable.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nFunciona correctamente y no se calienta, es muy cómodo de llevar.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI have a Popsocket on the back of my phone. It's a removable one, but I wanted to see if I didn't need to take it off to charge. My phone was able to charge wireless with it still on. Also have a thin phone case on as well when testing it.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThis is an great buy. It works great and led lights that change when your phone is charging are super helpful to make sure you phone is still charging. The only thing that is a little difficult is the pop socket on my phone. When I sit it on the charger it sometimes doesn’t pick up right away. But the product works great!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThey worked well, but wasnt something that I cared to use.  It did make it easier to quickly place my phone on the night stand and not worry if I hit the \"bullseye\" of my charger pad.  Issue was that it didnt magnetize to my phone through the case and it takes longer to remove the case than just plug it in.  Spend the money on a higher wattage quick charger brick and cord!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI misunderstood the reviews for another item and thought that I needed a wireless charger for that item. So, I got this. Turns out, I didn't need it after all but I like it! It charges everything so well, it looks cool, I love how it changes colors from green to blue, and I ended up using it to charge the aforementioned item anyway.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nLooks previously used . Scratches on top and filthy cable not bound up .Seems to work so I'll keep it.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI have a Samsung phone, it charged to slow\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe unit looks very sleek and classy. It is very thin and looks like black glass with lighted accents. The lights are not too bright and don't affect my sleeping even though it is right next to me on the night stand. I have not had the unit very long. If anything does occur I will update my review. Works as advertised and looks better in person.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nIt's a great charger that's for damn sure. Charges my Pixel lightening quick! The looks and overall design is gorgeous especially the bright LEDs to tell you if it's charging. My only big issue is that it doesn't have any grip to it at all. My phone just kinda slides about when it's on top. Which will sometimes take it off the charging area. Other than that one issue, it's a great charger!\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThis is a decent alternative to the true MagSafe Charger.  I have two of the Apple units and always hated the requirements to power them, must be USB-C PD at least 18W, etc. While this doesn't charge at 15W, you can use a standard USB-A with at least 2A (10W) and it will charge at 7.5W.  It even comes with a USB-C to USB-A adapter. Doesn't get hot.  Magnet works as well as MagSafe.  The fact that it's black means it wont get as dirty as the white cable and pad.  Overall happy with performance and value.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nIt works great even with the case on and I love it but it does charge slow that’s my only complaint. It’s great for traveling and easy to use.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThis is by far the best wireless charger I've purchased. I have purchased pricie ones from my carrier costing as much as $80 and it took so long to charge my phone.  I took it right back and got this one.  It's really slim and elegant, has an expensive look to it. Oh and the  light is so suttle it doesn't bother me when I'm asleep.  Big plus for me and sold me immediately is that you place the phone down and it's charging.  No wiggles or moving it around to get it to charge.  I bought a this one based on the reviews and the slim sleek look and I am happier than I expected, and it cost so much less. Wireless charging is not fast but this one does the job pretty fast.  If you are thinking of buying this, don't think anymore.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI have ordered two of these since I loved the 1st one so much. Also gave one as a gift. So convenient to put along your night stand or keep on the kitchen counter. My 1st one died on me. I contacted TOZO via email and with a few messages back an forth they gladly replaced the device in order to keep me as a customer. Thank You TOZO.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nWhen placed perfectly, your phone will charge fast. However, it's all too easy to just miss the charging spot, and let your phone rest overnight without charging. The most annoying feature however is the LED. The green is on all of the time and is super SUPER bright. So bright it lights up the bedroom. The LED turns to blue when actually charging your device, which surprisingly is dimmer than the green. In any case, the LED doesn't need to be on all of the time, and doesn't need to be this bright. Otherwise, a pretty good charger, and it is extremely thin and light.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI recently upgraded to a phone with wireless charging capability and this is the first wireless charger I have purchased. This is an excellent charger with superb design and represents, in terms of design, a significant step up from the most inexpensive models available. The charging pad is beautifully finished on its top surface and edges and has a non-slip base. The provided USB to mini-USB cable will plug into any USB power outlet and the charging performance appears excellent. Recognition of the presence of the phone is essentially instantaneous whereupon the LED bands (two, visible in the photo) turn from green to blue. The colors are very attractive and, since placed on the top surface, unobtrusive (there would be no concern about sleep interruption if this were placed on a nightstand). The unit is small and light and would make an excellent travel charger. In summary, this is a superbly designed and manufactured charger. Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe product works great and can be used as a night light. The only negative is that it comes without an AC connector.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nPlug and go, it’s very slim and nice looking. Got the black and when you put the phone on it it changes to flashing blue light , once it’s charged it goes blue. Can basically place the phone anywhere orotund the center , it’s not very piniky! And that’s a good thing. Very happy with this , it works with a case on my phone , looks great and does what it’s supposed to. It doesn’t charge as fast as the wall cable that you have to buy for the phone but I set it down before bed and it’s charged by morning . Highly recommend this!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIt is very slim and handy for traveling. IPhone 12 is charging slow than direct plugged in\\n',\n",
